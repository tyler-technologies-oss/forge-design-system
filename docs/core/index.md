## Parts

All Tyler apps require the following visual elements.

The omnibar is a user’s personal navigation kit. It holds everything a user needs to navigate the app they’re currently in, apps they typically go to, and apps they might need, as well tools to customize their navigation experience through notifications, language options, and help resources.

### [App launcher](/core/components/app-launcher)

App launcher is a persistent navigation component for users to switch context. It is a personal local map to navigate the Tyler ecosystem. It lives in the  user information section of omnibar and is represented by the Apps icon.
