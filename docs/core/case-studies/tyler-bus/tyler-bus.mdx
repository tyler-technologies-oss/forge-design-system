# Tyler Bus

_"We just took the Forge website and ran with it. We were able to build the mobile apps that we wanted to without making them completely native, just using Forge."_

## Overview & design decisions

Meet the new Tyler Bus suite, built with TCW components on a Blazor and progressive web app framework. The apps are used by bus drivers for local school systems,
enabling them to clock in and out, track students, and track regular maintenance for local buses.

As COVID hit and the team responded to new business requirements such as additional inspections and cleanings and remote clock-ins, the team opted to split a legacy
hardware device into a suite of smaller apps that could be used on clients' own devices.

The applications are multi-tenant progressive web apps (PWAs) built on Blazor, using Web Assembly. Blazor helped to bridge the gap for .NET developers. The team took
the pure Javascript TCW components and created a Blazor library of TCW components, contributing them back to the Forge team. The multi-tenant PWA framework allows the
apps to run in offline scenarios and be specific to an individual tenant. 

To ensure that the apps could be used on drivers' mobile devices, including tablets and phones, the team adapted some TCW components to accomodate larger touch targets
and larger font sizes where needed. While the components are built to meet Google Material Design's recommended 48px by 48px touch targets for mobile devices, the team
wanted to ensure a clean and effortless experience well adapted for mobile screens. Simplified data and the use of progressive disclosure through expansion panels and
detail pages ensured a mobile friendly experience. 

Additionally the team optimized the apps to support effortless switching between languages as needed, using Blazor language support.
