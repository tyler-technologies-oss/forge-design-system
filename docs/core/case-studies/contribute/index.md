## Submitting a case study

Have an app using Forge you'd like to share? Submit a case study to the Forge site!

### What you'll need:

1. A **quick screen recording demo** of your app. You can showcase your full app or just a specific pattern within your app. App demos tend to be short - between five and ten minutes. Demos will be uploaded to Microsoft Stream.
    - Both Mac and windows have built in screen recorders which will do just fine.
      - [Mac screen recorder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721)
      - [Windows screen recorder](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10)
2. A **short description** of the pattern. Be sure to include:
    - Persona, scenario, outcome (Ie, "As a Utilities customer service representative, I can access a customer's running balance and any late fees while I'm on the phone with them in order to determine late fees.")
    - Business case (Ie, "Create a customer service search and detail page in order to reduce time per call in a call center.")
    - Design decisions or iterations that were made. (Ie, "We first implemented a list for search results, but user testing revealed that the list items didn't contain enough information for users to identify the correct record, so we implemented a table with column filters instead.)
3. **Resources:**
    - Project contacts (PO, Lead developer (or dev point person), designer, product analyst, etc) - anyone who could answer questions about the design
    - Bitbucket or Github repo (optional) - if your repo is public to Tyler users, feel free to share the project as a resource for other developers
    - Demo server (optional) - if your project has a demo server where folks can view the finished product, provide a link and valid credentials 
    - Prototypes and/or design files (optional)
    - Any usability findings or worksheets from Forge Plays (optional)

To submit a case study, <a href="https://tylerjira.tylertech.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/21/create/609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a request for consulting</a> through Forge and mention submitting a case study in your ticket. We'll help you upload your demo to Microsoft Stream and we'll handle assembling the case study on the Forge site.
