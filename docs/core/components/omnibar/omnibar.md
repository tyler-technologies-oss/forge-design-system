# Omnibar

The omnibar is a user’s personal navigation kit. It holds everything a user needs to navigate the app they’re currently in, apps they typically go to, and apps they might need, as well tools to customize their navigation experience through notifications, language options, and help resources.

The omnibar is included in all applications and serves as a strong visual cue for the Tyler brand. To learn more about using and
implementing the omnibar, check out the component page [here](/components/omni/omnibar).
