## How to do it

1. Decide as a group which task you will start with.
2. Diverge: each participant sketches their interpretion of potential solutions for that task. Take 5-10 minutes to do this, or as long as the group needs. Participants should prioritize quantity over quality in these sketches.
3. Present: participants come together to present their sketches to the group to receive feedback and faciliate discussion.
4. Converge: use a dot-voting system to identify the strongest designs.
5. As a unit sketch a solution for each of the tasks combining the strongest designs from the group.
6. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until you have a designs for each of the tasks, or flows within your episode.
