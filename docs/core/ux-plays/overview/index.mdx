# Plays

Plays are a set of research activities to help you make and test design decisions in your domain. 

## Overview 

Research activities are important at each phase of the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user centered design process</a>. If your team hasn't used this process before, request a virtual <a href="https://tylerjira.tylertech.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/21/create/609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump Start</a>, a two day, hands-on workshop to introduce your team to the User Centered Design process.

## Picking plays

Plays can be done by product teams, developers, and UX-ers. They are meant for anyone involved in the design and development of a Tyler product. They may be done independently of the TUX team, or you may enlist TUX to aid in your engagement with plays. To do so, check out our [Consulting](/consulting) page.

Plays can be utilized throughout the design and development cycle. Determining what stage of the UCD process your product development is in will help determine which Play may be most appropriate.
