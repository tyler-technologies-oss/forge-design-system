# Competitor analysis: Discover

A competitor analysis involves researching competitor approaches including UI layouts, differentiators/competitive advantage, revenue model, content types, tone and copy, etc. A competitor analysis may be conducted at the discover or design phase, with different goals for each.

## Overview 

Discover your product strategy by researching how the problem you are solving is currently being resolved by your target user. This could be indirect, or hidden competitors, such as users' current work-arounds and solutions, or this could be direct competitors, such as established brands in the market-place that offer a similar solution.
