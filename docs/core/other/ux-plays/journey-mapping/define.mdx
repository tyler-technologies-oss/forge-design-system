## How to do it

1. Gather data using interviews, surveys, and secondary research on the experience a specific persona has when using a product for a specific task.
2. Describe the steps and affective and cognitive aspects of each step in a process the user follows to use the product for a specific task.
3. Starting with a horizontal curve, add the steps you discovered in your research data along with a point indicating the emotional aspect of the step. A point above the line is a positive emotion, and a point below the line is a negative emotion.
4. Add quotes - direct or composite - from your research participants to describe each step and the thinking and emotion users tend to experience at that step.
