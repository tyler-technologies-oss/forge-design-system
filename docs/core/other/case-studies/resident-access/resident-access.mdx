# Resident Access

_"Forge was an anchor for me throughout the entire project. The information was easy to navigate, and the in-depth explanation of the components helped simplify many
of my design decisions. I also heavily relied on Forge when communicating with the development team to both help explain design decisions, and use the development
tab for specific guidance."_

\- Amanda Cimino, designer

## Overview & design decisions

Meet the new Resident Access Suite, a hub where residents can engage with their local municipalities. The suite of resident access apps also integrates with apps such as
Utility Access, Energov CSS, and Web Recording to create a robust platform of applications to meet community needs. 

### Understanding the persona 

The team started with a rich understanding of their persona. Residents are likely to use the app suite on an irregular basis - most likely to pay annual bills, set up
auto-pay, or perform one time tasks such as applying for a business or building permit. They're looking for efficiency - they want to be able to make a payment or
conduct business with a town without necessarily having to create an account for a service they may not use all that frequently. Additionally, it's likely that they'll
be accessing these apps from a mobile device, in a variety of environmental contexts.

### Designing for the persona

With these expectations in mind, the team optimized the apps to be web responsive in order to create a delightful experience for users on mobile devices. See how the
team optimized the [omnibar](/components/omnibar#responsive), [tables](/components/table-data/table#responsive), [steppers](/components/stepper), and [tabs](/components/navigation/tabs/#responsive)
for mobile in the demo below.

To optimize for efficiency, the team built for both an authenticated and guest experience, allowing users make payments quickly and without the hassle of creating an
account. While payments can be made as a guest, users are encouraged to create an account  to save their payment details and set up recurring payments - rather than
force users to create accounts, the team opted to demonstrate the value an account adds instead. 

### Creating a cohesive experience with Forge 

The team opted to use consistent page layouts, account linking processes, and landing page layouts both to create development efficiencies in suite as well as to
promote learnability throughout the apps. Since the apps integrate closely with other community apps, patterns and components such as a
[white omnibar](/core/branding/community#2-omnibar-styling), [landing page layouts](/components/landing-page-layout), and account linking processes are
shared among all of Tyler's community apps. 

Using [steppers](/components/stepper) to simplify complex flows such as applying for a business license, the team chunked information into mamageable steps and
optimized for ease of use and task completion.

### Outcomes

Using a combination of persona driven design and the cohesion provided by Forge components and templates, the team built a set of mobile responsive applications
that optimize for efficiency and integrate well with the broader community app ecosystem.
