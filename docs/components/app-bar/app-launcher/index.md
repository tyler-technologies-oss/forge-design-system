## Responsive
The app launcher displays on responsive mobile web apps. Native apps should not use app launcher (internal app navigation should occur in the navigation drawer; external app navigation will be handled by the userâ€™s phone). 
On responsive web apps, the app launcher displays full screen at mobile sizes.
