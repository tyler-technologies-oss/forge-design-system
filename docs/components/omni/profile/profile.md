## Overview

The profile card features a user's personalized avatar if they've set one, their full name, and the email used to sign up with the app. Additionally, the card features a “Sign out” option as well as a link to their profile, if applicable.
For information about public facing profile patterns, check out this guidance.

For **unauthenticated users,** the avatar is replaced by a “sign in” button. Notifications are hidden; the help menu and app launcher remain.
