## Overview

Foreground content attracts more attention when background content displays a backdrop. A backdrop can be applied in a variety of ways, including:

- Darkening or lightening the surface and its content
- Reducing the opacity of the surface and its content

A backdrop is most often used in combination with dialogs, temporary drawers, steppers, and bottom sheets. Because it is interruptive to the experience,
it should be used sparingly, in order to give focus to a specific component.
