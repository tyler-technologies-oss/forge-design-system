## Overview 

Menus display lists of related options (which can be grouped together) as well as unrelated options. Menus appear when a user taps an interactive UI element such as an icon, button, action, or content, such as selected items or text.

Menus appear in front of all other permanent UI elements. They typically appear next to (or in front of) the element that generates them. If they are in a position to be cut off by the browser or screenâ€™s edge, the menu can instead appear to the left, right, or above the element that generates it.

## Parts 


### 1. Menu items

Menu items may use text only or may include icons. In general, choose consistency - either use icons for all or icons for none.

### 2. Categories

Menus may include multiple categories of information. Like information should be grouped together and separated by a divider or a section title.

### 3. Cascading menus

Menus can contain sub menus in a cascading style. Typically the sub menu opens to the right of the parent menu item, but when a menu opens close to the edge of the screen or browser window the menu can open on the left side.

<ImageBlock padded={false} caption="1. A menu with a sub menu open. <br>2. The sub menu can open on the left if there isn't enough room to display it to the right of the parent menu.">
