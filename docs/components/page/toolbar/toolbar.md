## Overview

The toolbar spans 100% width, uses a border to separate the toolbar from the content area, and has slots for placing any content at the start, center, and end. It can be used below the omnibar to display a page title and actions, within a nav drawer as a section, as a footer, or as header & footer in dialogs.

### Examples

- See tooltips in action in the [Employee Access Calendar case study](/case-studies/ess-calendar).
