## Overview

Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan.

They should make content actionable by making specific items easy to identify and act on. 

List items may be spaced using dividers or spacing.

### Use when 

- Displaying groups of related items that are primarily textual.

### Don't use when 

- Displaying content that is not primarily text.
- Displaying content with three or more well-defined dimensions that users might sort on. Instead, use a [table](/components/table/table).

### Components

List items may contain

- [Icon buttons](/components/buttons/icon-button)
- [Buttons](/components/buttons/button)
- [Checkboxes](/components/controls/checkbox)
- [Radio buttons](/components/controls/radio-button)
- [Switches](/components/controls/switch)

Use instead of a list

- Use a [table](/components/table/table) when displaying content with three or more well-defined dimensions that users might sort on.
- Use [cards](/components/cards/card) when displaying content that has images or that contains non homogenous data.
