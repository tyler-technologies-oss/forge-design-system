## Radio buttons

Radio buttons allow the user to select a single option from a set.

### Use when

- The user needs to see all available options. 
- The user can only select one option. 
- Comparing between the list of options is helpful. 

### Don't use when

- There are a large number of options or the set could be collapsed. Use a [select](/components/fields/select) instead.
- The user needs to select more than one option. Use [checkboxes](/components/controls/checkbox) instead.
- There is just selectable option (agreeing to Terms and Conditions, for example). Use a [checkbox](/components/controls/checkbox) instead.
- Screen real estate is limited. Use a [select](/components/fields/select) instead.
