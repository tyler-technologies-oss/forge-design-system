# Libraries

The Forge CDN hosts JavaScript and CSS assets for supporting libraries, such as the [Forge component library](https://forge.tylerdev.io/).

All libraries are available at the following base URL within the CDN:

```
https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/libs/
```

To view more information about how to consume the Forge components via the CDN see [here](https://forge.tylerdev.io/main/?path=/docs/guides-getting-started--page).

:::note
Currently only the Forge component library is hosted on the Forge CDN. We will update this page in the future if more libraries are supported.
