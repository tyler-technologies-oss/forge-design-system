# Fonts

The Forge CDN provides a common font to use for all Tyler applications. The font we use currently is Google's Roboto font.

You can load this font by simply adding the following to any webpage within the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.forge.tylertech.com/v1/css/tyler-font.css">
```
