# Designer assets: Framer

Build beautiful and accessible experiences that express Tyler's core values using a component library that matches our TCW components to spec. Tyler uses Figma as a collaborative, web based design tool. For advanced functional prototypes, we recommend using Framer.

## Getting started with Framer

Framer is an all-in-one tool that helps teams design every part of the product experience. Start in Framer and get to a functional prototype faster than ever—no code required.

In Framer, interactions are first-class throughout your whole workflow—wireframing, visual design, prototyping, design systems, handoff, and user testing. Create prototypes in the canvas with animations, transitions, and Smart Components and get better feedback from user tests, useful handoff code for engineers, and quicker buy-in from stakeholders.

**Use the Forge components directly in Framer!** Tyler has pulled in native Forge components with their full functionality that can be used in live prototypes.
