# Designer assets: Figma

Build beautiful and accessible experiences that express Tyler's core values using a component library that matches our Forge components to spec. Tyler uses Figma as a collaborative, web based design tool. For advanced functional prototypes, we recommend using Framer.

## Getting started with Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that is entirely browser-based, and therefore works not only on Macs, but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. Figma is the preferred design tool for teams using Forge. Use our Figma library of components that match our Forge components to spec. 

Figma viewer accounts are free but editor accounts require a paid subscription. To request editor rights, please contact <a href="mailto:arleigh.hays@tylertech.com">Arleigh Hays</a> with the following information:
- Name
- Email
- Role
- Direct manager for billing purposes
- The request should include a purchase approval statement

**Note:** The Editor subscription cost has been provisionally approved by funding manager pending the submission of PO. Requesting team will be charged $15 per user/per month through June 3, 2022. At that time, monthly users will be added to the annual subscription.

To request a viewer account, [submit a request](/consulting/) for "Low engagement consulting" from the Forge team and mention a "Figma viewer account" in your request.

## Required fonts

**Roboto**, a Google Web Font, is our official Tyler Forge font. Figma gives you access to an extensive catalog of Google Web Fonts. If additional fonts are required Figma does allow you to use local fonts.

If youâ€™re using the Figma Desktop app, then any local fonts will already be available to you. You can find these alongside the Google Web Fonts in the Font Picker.

## Recommended plugins

Right now, there are no required plugins for Figma. We do have a few recommendations to help speed up your workflow. We also encourage you to send through our Feedback tool any awesome Figma plugins you might discover.

Accessibility: [Stark](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark) or [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker)

## Working offline

Yes, you can do that! This is especially helpful if you need to work during a long flight or during your kids' soccer practice. Simply download the Figma desktop app, while connected to the internet open the projects you plan to work on offline and allow them to sync. Once you are reconnected to the internet the work you did offline will magically, I mean automatically, update your projects in the browser views.
