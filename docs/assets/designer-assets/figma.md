# Designer assets: Figma

Build beautiful and accessible experiences that express Tyler's core values using a component library that matches our Forge components to spec. Tyler uses Figma as a collaborative, web based design tool.

## Getting started with Figma

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that can be run locally as an app, or can be accecced via web browser. Therefore, Figma works not only on Macs, but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. Figma is the preferred design tool for teams using Forge. Use our Figma library of components that match our Forge components to spec.

In order to get started with Figma, you'll need to begin a request to gain access to use the program.


### Gaining Access to Figma

To request Figma for yourself or your staff, use the Request access to applications or licenses form in the JSM Help Center. You can find the<a href="https://help.center.tylertech.com/servicedesk/customer/portals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> request form here</a>.

From there, follow: **Help Center > Tyler Internal Support (IT) > Request access to applications or licenses**


On the **Request access to applications or licenses** form, include the following information:

- **Are you submitting this on behalf of someone else** (Yes or No)
- **Add additional users for visibility** (optional)
- **What can we help you with?** For example, enter **Figma Subscription(s) for Name(s)**
- **Which application(s) do you need access to?** Start typing the name of the product rather than scrolling and select the appropriate subscription.
- **Quantity of Licenses Requested.** Enter the number of licenses needed.
- **Please provide any additional details that may be relevant.** Add relevant information here regarding users who will need the license, etc.

Once the ticket is submitted, the requests for paid subscriptions will go to the userâ€™s manager for approval. Once approved, they will head to Licensing for provisioning.

If you have any questions about the licensing of Figma, reach out to <a href="mailto:arleigh.hays@tylertech.com">Arleigh Hays</a>.


### Understanding Figma Costs

There is both a view-only mode, which is free, and a paid full access mode. For the full access mode, there are three tiers:

- **View Only** - Free, can only view documents
- **Figma Collab** (FigJam) - $60 plus tax per user per year (Includes access to FigJam and Figma Slides)
- **Figma Dev** (Dev Mode) - $420 plus tax per user per year (Includes the above + Dev Mode)
- **Figma Full** (Editor/Design) - $900 plus tax per user per year (Includes the above + Figma Design and Figma Draw)

Key points:

- The cost for an additional user(s) is prorated to our anniversary date, January 8.
- Net new adds are trued up each quarter on the 8th of the month.
- We cannot downgrade users prior to true up and upgrade them after. This is violation of the SLA. There will likely be some exceptions around role change, interns, rehires etc. which we will address as they arise.


Once you have a Figma account, sign in with your Tyler SSO and you're good to go!

## Working offline

Yes, you can do that! Simply download the Figma desktop app, and while connected to the internet open the projects you plan to work on offline and allow them to sync. Once you are reconnected to the internet again, the work you did offline will automatically update your projects.
