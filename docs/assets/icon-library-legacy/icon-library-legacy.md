# Icon library (1.x version)

This is the legaxy 1.x icon library. This library has 3 different sets of icons to choose from. If you want to see the new icon library which references the 2.x package and consolidates the icons into one single set, [click here](/assets/icon-library/)

Forge provides a purposeful set of iconography. Consistent iconography is an expression of brand and creates clear visual patterns and expectations. Icons can be accessed as a library in Figma (designers), and as a font or SVG icon library (developers).
