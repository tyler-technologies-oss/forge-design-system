# Icon library

Forge provides a purposeful set of iconography. Consistent iconography is an expression of brand and creates clear visual patterns and expectations. Icons can be accessed as a library in Figma (designers), and as a font or SVG icon library (developers). This icon library leverages the 2.x version of the tyler-icons package. To see the legacy icon library, [click here](/assets/icon-library-legacy/)
