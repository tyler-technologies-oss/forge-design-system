# Recipe: Internal server error (500)

An unhandled problem occurred on the server that prevents the request from being fulfilled.

Examples where this could apply:

- When the server fails to process a request due to some internal error
- The request handler threw an exception
- The process responsible for handling the request terminated unexpectedly

:::note
This error is distinguished from 400-series errors in that 500-series errors indicate a problem occurred on the server, whereas 400-series errors
indicate a problem with the request to the server, which is a problem on the client (browser) side.
