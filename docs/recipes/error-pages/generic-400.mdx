# Recipe: Generic error (400)

Examples where this could apply:

- As a generic error
- When the error doesn't fit any other of the other available error pages
- In response to a request that was rejected by the server with a 400 status code

:::note
Since this error page has no context, it should only be used if none of the other error pages are applicable.
