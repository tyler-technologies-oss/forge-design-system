# Recipe: Offline error

This is used when a client application fails to make an asynchronous request to the server due to network connectivity issues.

Examples where this could apply:

- the local network is down
- a network between the client and server is down
- a VPN connection is not running, or not working properly

:::note
This is usually only applicable when your client-side application is handling the request (such as with an XMLHttpRequest or Javascript fetch() call).
Normal page navigation while offline will result in the browser displaying its own internal error page.
