# Recipe: Table with icon actions

This recipe demonstrates how to add actions to each row using icon buttons.

:::note
Ensure your icons use a tooltip to make it clear what action is taken.

Any action which cannot be undone should typically come with a confirmation dialog in case the user accidentally clicks the icon.
