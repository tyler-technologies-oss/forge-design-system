## Nested tables

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-datatable-recipe-with-expandable-rows-complex"
  componentList="card table">

:::note
**Nesting tables is strongly discouraged for clarity and readability.** In general, we recommend navigating to a detail page to show nested tables. 

In this example, the nested table has only three rows and could work. We don't recommend nesting tables that would be longer than this.
