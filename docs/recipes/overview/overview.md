What are recipes you ask? They are actual implementations of common Forge patterns using real Forge components!

Recipes are a great way to help inspire your designs, as well as assist developers with implementation details to avoid spending valuable
time figuring out how to create a common design pattern.

You may be wondering why recipes aren't distributed as pre-built components. The reason for this is because while they are very common, there
are always slight differences based on the target persona for a specific application. In certain cases where a strict design is necessary, those
patterns will be implemented as a component, otherwise recipes are intended to provide inspiration and allow for you to adapt the pattern to your
needs while staying true to the intended design.
