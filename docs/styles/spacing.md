# Spacing

Clear layouts allow users to understand and navigate content quickly and easily. Use these guidelines to create intuitive web layouts.

## Overview

Forge uses a 4px system for its layout structure. This means that content and components can be divided by 4 and all fall on a balanced grid. For example, spacing between elements in a layout is typically set to 24px, with more dense pages using 16px. 

These are used for spacing inside of elements (padding) as well as spacing around elements (margin).
