# Illustrations

Illustrations are a key element of our Tyler brand system. Illustrations provide a sense of personality and familiarity and can make complex ideas more accessible.  

## Overview

Illustrations exist to thoughtfully convey ideas - they should not be used for purely decorative purposes.

## Parts 

Our illustrations system is broken up into 3 categories: Spot, Spot Hero and Hero.

### Spot illustrations 

Use these small simple illustrations to convey meaning within a component such as a card. They’re used to add meaning, clarity, and visual intrigue.

## Spot hero illustrations

Use these larger and more complex illustrations to communicate literal or metaphorical ideas within a limited space. They’re used for empty states, error messages, page headers, and larger card graphics.

## Hero illustrations

Hero illustrations are more complex and heavy on narrative. They are interesting, engaging and usually feature people in order to tell a full story. Use them for larger content containers such as full width headers.
