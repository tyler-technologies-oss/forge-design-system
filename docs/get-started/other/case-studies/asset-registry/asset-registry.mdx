# Asset Registry

_"Forge was kind of the glue that held the entire project together. It made it easy to create the layout and design of the program itself, and handing it off to the front end devs working on it was easy because of it. Everything I built was easy for the front end team to replicate since everything was based around Forge components - it made prototyping as realistic as possible to the final developed piece too, which was great."_

\- Eric Wayne, designer

## Overview & design decisions

Meet the new EAM Asset Registry, reimagined using Forge patterns and components.

Asset Registry, designed to help employees and field technicians register, track, maintenance, and update assets owned by the town, is used on desktops, multi monitor
experiences, and large tablets. The app is used on desktops, multi monitor experiences, and large tablets.

The application uses a table with column filtering and customizable columns to allow users to view and interact with thousands of assets. The [table](/components/table/table)
allows the app to show a large number of assets on a screen, while customizable columns allow for constraining the set to a manageable number of columns. Column
filtering empowers users to find a specific asset or set of assets quickly. 

The team was designing for a desktop or multi monitor experience, based on user feedback around common setups. The team opted for a [mini nav](/components/navigation/drawer/#4-mini)
in order maximize real estate on the screen, since they're designing for larger screens. Additionally, the app uses resizable sections to allow users to view a map and
data side by side, hide the map, or bring the map into its own window or separate monitor.

Assets have the potential for deep and complex hierarchies of data. Eric simplified a complex hierarchy using a combination of [tab](/components/navigation/tabs), anchored
navigation, and clear sections to keep things clear and concise.

The prototype performed well in user testing with clients.
