## How to do it

1. Define your persona. Your persona is an archetype of your target user based on their behavior patterns. You should include information such as goals, knowledge, responsibilities, skills, and expectations in your persona and avoid things like age and demographic. 
2. Specify the scenario. The scenario is the story, or the plot that your persona is the leading character in. The scenario should be specific and provide context.
3. Distinguish the outcome. The outcome is the desired result your persona expects from the experience.
4. Compile this information into an artifact or presentation to share with the team.
