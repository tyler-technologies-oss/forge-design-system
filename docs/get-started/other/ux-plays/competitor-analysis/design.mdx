# Competitor analysis: Design

A competitor analysis involves researching competitor approaches including UI layouts, differentiators/competitive advantage, revenue model, content types, tone and copy, etc. A competitor analysis may be conducted at the discover or design phase, with different goals for each.

## Overview 

Begin your design process by researching how your direct competitors, ie the brands in the market-place that offer a similar solution, are solving the problem. Your goal is to gain an understanding of what your persona may be using currently, and therefore may expect from your product, as well as draw inspiration from and create differentiation for your own solution.
