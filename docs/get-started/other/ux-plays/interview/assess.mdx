## How to do it

1. Identify your assumptions.
2. Develop hypotheses based on your assumptions. Ask, "If this assumption is correct, what would have to be true?" 
3. Write open-ended questions that address your hypotheses from multiple angles. 
4. Organize your questions by topic or chronologically following a task or event.
5. Identify your ideal user â€“ the one who would value your solution most. 
6. Recruit people who are similar to your ideal user to interview.
7. Interview your participants, asking them the open-ended questions you developed. Record each interview!
8. Analyze your findings. We recommend [Affinity mapping](/get-started/other/ux-plays/affinity-mapping).
9. Prioritize design, development, and further research work.
