## How to do it

1. Make a copy of the workbook above to record findings & analysis. We recommend watching the Mesh session provided to take your usability test to the next level!
2. Identify your assumptions about how your persona would use the design.
3. Develop hypotheses based on your assumptions to prove or disprove through the usability session.  
4. Draft your script. Write scenarios and tasks that you want to observe your persona undertake by using the prototype. These tasks should address your hypotheses from multiple angles. 
5. Identify and recruit potential participants who represent your target persona.
6. Schedule 30-60 minute sessions with 3-5 participants in order to capture the majority of usability issues.
7. Conduct the sessions remotely via GoToMeeting or in person. Make sure you record the session after asking the participants consent. Always follow your script.
8. Analyze your results. Review your findings to identify patterns and trends in the data. Turn those findings into insights by inferring what the patterns might mean.
9. Recommend changes or identify further questions for the design features to consider.
10. Prioritize design, development, and further research work.
