## Parts

All Tyler apps require the following visual elements. 

### [Omnibar](/components/omni/omnibar)

The omnibar is a user’s personal navigation kit. It holds everything a user needs to navigate the app they’re currently in, apps they typically go to, and apps they might need, as well tools to customize their navigation experience through notifications, language options, and help resources.

---

### [App launcher](/components/omni/app-launcher)

App launcher is a persistent navigation component for users to switch context. It is a personal local map to navigate the Tyler ecosystem. It lives in the  user information section of omnibar and is represented by the Apps icon.

### Scaffold

The scaffold provides the basic page layout for Tyler apps.

The scaffold is the foundation of layout in Forge apps. The scaffold places the main content of the page:

- [Omnibar](/components/omni/omnibar) (required)
- [Navigation drawer](/components/navigation/navigation-drawer) (optional)
- Page title (required)
- Footer (optional): [workforce apps](/get-started/branding-workforce#3-footer-optional), [community apps](/get-started/branding-community#4-footer-optional)

To learn more about using and implementing the scaffold, check out the component page [here](/components/layouts/scaffold).

### [Color](/styles/color)

### [Illustrations](/get-started/styles/illustrations)

Illustrations are a key element of the Tyler brand system. Illustrations provide a sense of personality and familiarity and can make complex ideas more accessible.

Forge provides a purposeful set of typographic styles. Consistently tying typographic styles to appropriate sections and functions in an interface creates clear visual patterns and expectations.
