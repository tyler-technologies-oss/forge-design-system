# Common messages

This guide will help you craft consistent copy specific to the needs of your product teams that fit within the overarching voice and tone of Tyler Tech.

## Overview 

Use the following guides to help you create copy for common messages in your application.

<ToneDef name="Okay, OK, and O.K." doValue="OK" dontValue="&#34;Okay,&#34; &#34;O.K.&#34;">

**Opt for ​OK​ over the others,** ensuring that it is always used in all caps.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Sign in / sign out and log in / log out" doValue="&#34;Sign in,&#34; &#34;sign out&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Sign-in,&#34; &#34;Sign off,&#34; &#34;Login,&#34; &#34;Logoff,&#34; &#34;Log-on,&#34; &#34;Log on&#34;">

**Use ​"sign in​" and ​"sign out,"**​ which is less technical than ​log in​ and ​log out.

While these phrases are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing. For consistency it’s important we use the same one throughout our applications.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Such as, ie, eg" doValue="&#34;Such as&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Ie,&#34; &#34;Eg,&#34;">

**Use ​"such as"** ​when adding an example or additional context. &#34;I​e&#34;​ and ​&#34;eg​&#34; are not as clear.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Auto pay, auto-pay, and autopay" doValue="&#34;Automatic payment,&#34; &#34;auto pay&#34;" dontValue="&#34;auto-pay,&#34; &#34;autopay&#34;">

For our purposes, **use ​automatic payment​ whenever possible** to avoid confusion. Use a​uto pay when it is not possible to use the entire phrase, such as in instances where you are tight on space.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Can, may, and might" doValue="&#34;Can you see my screen?&#34; &#34;Can you fix this bug today?&#34; &#34;May I borrow your book?&#34; &#34;It looks like the sun might come out today after all.&#34;" dontValue="&#34; &#34;">

These three words are often used and frequently mixed up. Using them correctly helps to maintain consistency across our applications.

Can​ implies ability, m​ay​ implies permission or likelihood of something happening, and m​ight implies a small possibility of something happening.

## Delivering good news

When delivering good news, use positive upbeat words and exclamation points (sparingly).

<Columns columns="two" type="equal" denseSpacing={true}>
  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="do">Alright</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Way to go</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Nice work</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Success</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>

  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Don't use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Amazing</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Wonderful</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Fantastic</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>
</Columns>

## Examples

"Nice work! You just created your first journal entry."

"Looks like you’re calling it a day. You’ve successfully signed out. See you soon!"

## Delivering bad news

When delivering bad news, we should be clear and concise. Tell the user what went wrong, but give them options to fix it or to move on from it quickly.

<Columns columns="two" type="equal">
  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="do">Sorry</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Oops</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Oh no</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>

  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Don't use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Bummer</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">That sucks</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Too bad</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Yikes</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>
</Columns>

## Examples

"Houston, we have a problem. Something got tangled up on our end. Contact your system administrator for help."

"Sorry, we dozed off. You were away so we logged you out. Sign in to get back to what you were doing."

"Uh oh, your browser is not supported by this application. Hang in there. Switching to the latest version of [supported browsers here] should do the trick."

:::note

Avoid using exclamation points when delivering bad news.

<ToneDef name="Deleting a record" doValue="&#34;Delete this record?&#34;,  &#34;Once it’s gone, it’s gone. Deleting this document will remove it from all linked accounts. Are you sure you want to delete it?&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Do you really want to delete this document?&#34;">

Confirm the correct record is deleted; match message severity with error severity.

</ToneDef>
  
<ToneDef name="Simple commands" doValue="&#34;Save,&#34; &#34;Continue,&#34; &#34;Next,&#34; &#34;Select,&#34; &#34;Delete&#34;" dontValue="Click items in the left nav to explore the product.">

Only use phrases such as “Nice work” and “Good job” after a process that is either lengthy, confusing, or difficult as reassurance to keep the user going and to confirm that their changes have been recognized.

These phrases should not be used for quick inputs of information such as in form fields. This is a TEST!

<ToneDef name="Unsaved changes" doValue="&#34;Hold up! You have unsaved changes. Do you want to save before you go?&#34; &#34; Save changes?&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Unsaved changes!&#34;">

Remind users to save their changes if they navigate away without saving changes. 

Always include a confirmation for the user to select between saving and discarding their changes.
