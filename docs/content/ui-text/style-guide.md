# Style guide

This guide will help you craft consistent copy specific to the needs of your product teams that fit within the overarching voice and tone of Tyler Tech.

## Overview

The following basic style guide will help us use consistent grammar and punctuation across Tyler applications. 

<ToneDef name="Abbreviations" doValue="&#34;Open Manager Self Service to access information about this employee.&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Open MSS to access information about this employee.&#34;">

Use sparingly and only for broadly familiar abbreviations. They should always be capitalized.

When referencing the name of a Tyler product or service within another product or anyclient-facing context, use the entire name.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Ampersands (&)" doValue="&#34;Images and attachments&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Income & disbursements&#34;">

The word “and” should be used first, whenever possible. If the situation does not allow for the entire word, such as in the context of saving space, use an ampersand (&) over the plus sign (+).

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Apostrophe (')" doValue="&#34;Can't,&#34; &#34;don't,&#34; &#34;Ross's&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Multiple application's&#34;">

Use apostrophes in possessives and contractions.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Colons (:)" doValue="&#34;The following reports are ready: Monthly Transactions, Quarterly Payroll, and Annual Budget.&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Reporting queue finished: needs attention.">

Use colons before lists.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Commas (,)" doValue="&#34;The following reports are ready: Monthly Transactions, Quarterly Payroll, and Annual Budget.&#34;" dontValue="Approve time off requests for Allison Wolf, Jay McCormick and Gavin Pohl.">

Use commas to separate words in a list including one before the last word in the list (also known as the Oxford comma). Commas should also be used in numbers greater than three digits.

</ToneDef>
  
<ToneDef name="Contractions" doValue="&#34;Oops, something isn’t right.&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Could've&#34;">

Use common contractions such as isn’t, can’t, etc. Use both words, like "c​ould have​" in place of uncommon contractions such as "c​ould’ve"​.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Ellipses (...)" doValue="&#34;Hmm... those keywords didn’t turn up any results. Try your search again.&#34;" dontValue="&#34;The following records need attention: Monthly Transactions, Quarterly Payroll, etc ... &#34;">

Use only to represent a pause or where something has been omitted.

</ToneDef>
  
<ToneDef name="First / second person" doValue="&#34;Use the new feature to..." dontValue="&#34;Our new feature allows you to...&#34;">

Opt for writing in second person (you, your) over first person (we, our) whenever possible to inspire a sense of ownership in our clients.
