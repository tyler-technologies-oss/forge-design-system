# Spacing

Clear layouts allow users to understand and navigate content quickly and easily. Use these guidelines to create intuitive web layouts. 

## Overview

The Forge spacing system is based on multiples of 8px. These are used for spacing inside of elements (padding) as well as spacing around elements (margin).
