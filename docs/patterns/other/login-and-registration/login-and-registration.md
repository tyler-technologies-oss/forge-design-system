# Login & Registration

Make a good first impression! Registering and logging in to a Tyler app are the first experience most users have with Tyler apps. 

## Overview 

Login and registration for Tyler products is handled by [Tyler Identity](https://confl.tylertech.com/display/TID/Tyler+Identity) (TID).

Tyler Identity represents Tylerâ€™s vision for a comprehensive, modern and secure identity-management solution. Tyler Identity will manage user identities and provide authentication and claims-management services using modern security protocols.

Login & registration aligns with the following user goals:

1. Registering for an account 
2. Signing into an account 
3. Retrieving a forgotten password

## 1. Register

Users hit "register" from the TID login screen. They'll be sent a confirmation email to confirm their account before they can log in.

Some apps may not allow users to self register; they may need to be added as a user by a system admin.

## 2. Sign in 

Users are routed to a separate page to log in to Tyler apps. Sign in pages do not display the omnibar. They are not tenant branded nor do they display a background image.

## 3. Forgotten password

Users may reset their password by hitting a link.

Some apps don't allow users to reset their own password for security reasons and instead provide that an admin must reset passwords.
