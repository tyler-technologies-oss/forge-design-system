# Error pages recipes

Recipes for the page state component.

## Guidance

Page state errors use illustrations hosted in the Forge CDN. To learn more about the CDN, check out our [CDN overview](/assets/cdn/overview).

You'll see that the recipes below * use links to the CDN for our illustrations instead of hosting them with the project itself**. You can copy the HTML
as is provided below to render our page states -- without having to host the illustrations yourself.

:::info
Hit **Run project** on the following examples and choose either **Editor **or **Both** to view the HTML.

## Generic error (400)

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-general-error"
  componentList="omnibar page-state">

Examples where this could apply:

- As a generic error
- When the error doesn't fit any other of the other available error pages
- In response to a request that was rejected by the server with a 400 status code

:::note
Since this error page has no context, it should only be used if none of the other error pages are applicable.

## Unauthorized access (401 & 403)

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-403"
  componentList="omnibar page-state">

Examples where this could apply:

- The user is attempting to take an action that requires they are currently logged in
- The user is logged in, but they do not have the required permissions to access a resource
- When attempting to make a change that violates some constraint such as duplicating a unique key
- When the service requires different parameters than those that were provided

## Unauthorized access (401 & 403) (version 2)

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-unauthorized-access-2"

## Not found (404)

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-404"
  componentList="omnibar page-state">

Examples where this could apply:

- Any time a page is missing
- Any time a specific resource could not be found which prevents the page from functioning

:::note
Most web servers allow you to set a 404 page by providing a URL in the web server configuration.
If you create a specific page to host this component, you can configure server to use that page to cover any requests which result in a 404 error.

## Internal server error (500)

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-500"
  componentList="omnibar page-state">

An unhandled problem occurred on the server that prevents the request from being fulfilled.

Examples where this could apply:

- When the server fails to process a request due to some internal error
- The request handler threw an exception
- The process responsible for handling the request terminated unexpectedly

:::note
This error is distinguished from 400-series errors in that 500-series errors indicate a problem occurred on the server, whereas 400-series errors
indicate a problem with the request to the server, which is a problem on the client (browser) side.

## Offline

<RecipeDemo
  href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/forge-recipes-error-offline"
  componentList="omnibar page-state">

This is used when a client application fails to make an asynchronous request to the server due to network connectivity issues.

Examples where this could apply:

- the local network is down
- a network between the client and server is down
- a VPN connection is not running, or not working properly

:::note
This is usually only applicable when your client-side application is handling the request (such as with an XMLHttpRequest or Javascript fetch() call).
Normal page navigation while offline will result in the browser displaying its own internal error page.

:::note
This is essentially a specific type of 403 error where access is not granted due to a missing subscription/license.
