# UXW Sweeps

Ideally, weâ€™re developing UX copy alongside the design process so it can be user tested in parallel with design. There are instances, however, when we need to work backwards and evaluate copy that has already been released - we call this a UXW Sweep.

When conducting a UXW Sweep, you will apply [UXR best practices](/ux-content/) as you work through the following steps:

1. Work with the product team to understand why the copy sweep has been requested.
2. Understand the UI context, intended persona(s), and user flows before you begin writing.
3. Consider the impact to existing users if the copy is already released.
4. Provide multiple options for each suggested copy change and discuss those options with the product team. Refer to [common message guidance](/ux-content/common-messages) throughout the sweep as needed.
5. If time allows, user test or survey to ensure copy changes make the user experience clearer. This is especially important if copy changes will be made to a product with large numbers of existing users.

Product teams may differ in how they want copy changes delivered. Discuss this with your product team before you begin. 

Some product teams prefer a PowerPoint with screenshots and copy suggestions in the notes. 

In other cases, a text document is sufficient:
