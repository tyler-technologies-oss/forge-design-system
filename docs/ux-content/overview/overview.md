# What is UX Writing?
UX Writing is the design of written content that appears in the UI, including messages, hints, descriptions, labels, explanations, and even the format of data like numbers and dates. 

It applies design thinking to the written content that guides users through experiences.

> "Screen space is limited, and attention spans are short so UXW prioritizes a goal-oriented style, rather than adherence to grammar. The style and word choices that are best for interfaces aren't always the same as the rules for formal writing."<br />&mdash; Alex Hays, UX Writer, Google
