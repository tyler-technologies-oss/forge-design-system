## What is UX Writing (UXW)?

UX Writing is the planning, design, creation, and management of words in an interface. It applies design thinking to the written content that guides users through experiences.

> "Screen space is limited, and attention spans are short so UXW prioritizes a goal-oriented style, rather than adherence to grammar. The style and word choices that are best for interfaces aren't always the same as the rules for formal writing."<br />&mdash; Alex Hays, UX Writer, Google

## UXW Principles

**Be clear:** Use words your users understand.

**Be consistent:** Use words consistently across the user interface.

**Be concise:** Say only what you need to say. Show information gradually, as it’s needed.

**Be helpful:** Guide, reassure, and empathize with users. Talk to the user in the second person - use “you.”

**Use active voice:** Message sent v. message has been sent
