# Introduction

This guide will help you craft consistent copy specific to the needs of your product teams that fit within the overarching voice and tone of Tyler Tech.

## UX Writing (UXW)

UX Writing is the planning, design, creation, and management of words in an interface. It applies design thinking to the written content that connects with and guides users through experiences. 

*"Screen space is limited, and attention spans are short so UXW prioritizes a goal-oriented style, rather than adherence to grammar. The style and word choices that are best for interfaces aren't always the same as the rules for formal writing."* - Alex Hays, UXW Google
  
### UXW Principles
  
**Be clear**
* Use words your users understand.
  * Turn on v. Enable
  * Preparing Video v. Buffering

**Be consistent**
* Use words consistently across the UI.

**Be concise**
* Say only what you need to say. Show information gradually, as it’s needed.

**Be helpful**
* Guide, reassure, and empathize with users.

**Use present tense**
* Message sent v. message has been sent

### UXW Pro Tips

**Write in Context**
*Always view the UI and context where the copy will live.

**Match Messages and Labels**
*When messages and labels match each other, a person’s next step is clearer.

## Voice vs tone

Tyler’s **v​oice**​ represents our personality as a company. Our **​tone** may adapt to fit the product, situation, or specific persona, but our voice never changes.

Our voice is a written portrayal of our company brand and in order to deliver a consistent user experience across products and product suites we must exercise consistency in the copy within our products.

**Examples**

Here is an example of the same message and voice, but two different tones to account for various audiences. Behind both of them is a warm, welcoming demeanor, but the words chosen fit slightly different contexts.

- (To a close friend or colleague) “Hey! How’s it going?”
- (To a client you may not know well) “Good morning. How are you today?”

## Tyler's core values 

The first step in defining our voice and tone is to take a look at who Tyler Tech is as a company, which is also our voice.

1. **Transparent​** – We strive to be transparent with our clients, but use appropriate discretion with proprietary information and client privacy.
2. **Conversational**​ – We directly engage with clients in a personal nature, though we are not overly relaxed. For example, we don’t use slang.
3. **Encouraging/Empowering​** – We inspire confidence in our clients, we presume their capability and skill in what they do.
4. **Succinct​** – We are clear and direct, but not curt and dismissive. We try to achieve the balance of saying just enough by using the fewest words possible to convey the message.
5. **Positive​** – We are positive, but not overly enthusiastic.
6. **Knowledgeable​** – We are experienced in our industry and the public sector, but not at the
point of being elitist or unapproachable.
7. **Serving / helping​** – we want them to effectively be able to do their jobs
