# Common messages

This guide will help you craft consistent copy specific to the needs of your product teams that fit within the overarching voice and tone of Tyler Tech.

## OK
<ToneDef name="Okay, OK, and O.K." doValue="OK" dontValue="&#34;Okay,&#34; &#34;O.K.&#34;">

**Opt for ​OK​ over the others,** ensuring that it is always used in all caps.

</ToneDef>

## Sign in and sign out
<ToneDef name="Sign in / sign out and log in / log out" doValue="&#34;Sign in,&#34; &#34;sign out&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Sign-in,&#34; &#34;Sign off,&#34; &#34;Login,&#34; &#34;Logoff,&#34; &#34;Log-on,&#34; &#34;Log on&#34;">

**Use ​"sign in​" and ​"sign out,"**​ which are less technical than ​log in​ and ​log out.

Additionally, it is important to consistently use **"sign in"** and **"sign out"** even though log in and log out have equivalent meanings.

Last but not least, note the spacing and lack of punctuation. "Sign in" and "sign out" are both two words, not separated by a &#34;&#8212;&#34;.

</ToneDef>

## Such as (not e.g. or i.e.)
<ToneDef name="Such as, ie, eg" doValue="&#34;such as&#34;" dontValue="&#34;i.e.&#34;, &#34;e.g.&#34;">

**Use ​"such as"** ​when adding an example or additional context. &#34;I​e&#34;​ and ​&#34;eg​&#34; are not as clear.

</ToneDef>

## Automatic payment (or auto pay)
<ToneDef name="Auto pay, auto-pay, and autopay" doValue="&#34;Automatic payment,&#34; &#34;auto pay&#34;" dontValue="&#34;auto-pay,&#34; &#34;autopay&#34;">

For our purposes, **use ​automatic payment​ whenever possible** to avoid confusion. Use a​uto pay when it is not possible to use the entire phrase, such as in instances where you are tight on space.

</ToneDef>

<ToneDef name="Can, may, and might" doValue="&#34;Can you see my screen?&#34; &#34;, &#34; &#34;May I borrow your book?&#34;, &#34;It looks like the sun might come out today after all.&#34;" dontValue="&#34;Might I help?&#34;, &#34;Can I help?&#34;">

These three words frequently mixed up.

- "Can​" implies ability.
- "M​ay​" implies permission OR likelihood.
- "M​ight" implies likehood.

</ToneDef>

## Delivering bad news

When delivering bad news, we should be clear and concise. Tell the user what went wrong, but give them options to fix it or to move on from it quickly.

<Columns columns="two" type="equal">
  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="do">Sorry</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Oops</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="do">Oh no</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>

  <div>
    <DoDontGrid titleText="Don't use">
      <DoDontTextSection>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Bummer</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">That sucks</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Too bad</DoDontText>
        <DoDontText type="dont">Yikes</DoDontText>
      </DoDontTextSection>
    </DoDontGrid>
  </div>
</Columns>

### Examples

"Houston, we have a problem. Something got tangled up on our end. Contact your system administrator for help."

"Sorry, we dozed off. You were away so we logged you out. Sign in to get back to what you were doing."

"Uh oh, your browser is not supported by this application. Hang in there. Switching to the latest version of [supported browsers here] should do the trick."

:::note
Avoid using exclamation points when delivering bad news.

<DoDontGrid titleText="Do">
  <DoDontTextSection>

Only use phrases such as “Nice work” and “Good job” after a process that is either lengthy, confusing, or difficult as reassurance to keep the user going and to confirm that their changes have been recognized.

These phrases should not be used for quick inputs of information such as in form fields. This is a TEST!
