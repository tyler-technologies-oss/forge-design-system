# URLs

If a URL can be located without the prefix, drop the prefix. 
When incorporating a link do not write about how to interact with a link.  Don't use "click on" or "click." Instead, try to link the URL as a natural phrase in the sentence, or link an entire short phrase. For example, “show all open jobs at Tyler Tech” Open jobs would be the clickable link. 

Do:

* Show additional jobs at Tyler Tech.
* Show jobs.

Don’t:

* Click https://www.tylertech.com/careers/job-openings to view all open jobs at Tyler Tech.
