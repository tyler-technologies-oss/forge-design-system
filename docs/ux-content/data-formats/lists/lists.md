# Lists
Use bullets instead of dashes. Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each bulleted item. End all bulleted items that are complete sentences with periods (not semicolons or commas), but do not punctuate the end of fragments.

Bullet points are preferred unless the exact order or the exact number of items is significant. Numbered lists follow the rules for bulleted lists.
