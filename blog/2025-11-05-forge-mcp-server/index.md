We’re excited to announce the launch of the **Tyler Forge™ MCP Server**, a new way to bring the **power of Forge** directly into your favorite AI coding assistants. Whether you’re using Claude, Codex, or another MCP-compatible tool, you can now give your AI instant access to the full Tyler Forge™ design system and component library documentation — **right where you code**.

## Introduction

The **Forge MCP Server** connects your AI development tools to the official Tyler Forge™ documentation, giving them real-time awareness of the components, APIs, and design tokens that power our design system. This means your AI assistants can:

- **Discover and understand components** — Quickly find the right UI element for the job  
- **Generate framework-ready examples** — Produce accurate, accessible code for Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and more  
- **Validate component usage** — Ensure your code follows Forge best practices and API conventions  
- **Access design tokens** — Bring consistent colors, spacing, and typography directly into your workflow  
- **Stay aligned** — Keep your implementation consistent with Tyler Forge™ design and accessibility guidelines
- **Migrate between versions** — Get help updating your code when new Forge releases come out 

All of this happens through a **progressive disclosure model**, meaning the AI receives just the right amount of information at the right time — minimizing noise while maximizing accuracy.

### 🎨 Design System Ready
Give your AI assistants instant access to the full Tyler Forge™ design system — including components, API documentation, and design tokens — all version-aware and up to date.

### ⚙️ Developer Focused
Generate framework-aware examples, validate component usage, and follow accessibility best practices automatically. Spend less time searching docs and more time coding.

### 💡 Forge Mode Enabled
Activate `forge_mode` to guide your AI with built-in context and rules for accurate Forge-related coding. It’s like turning on Forge’s autopilot — your AI instantly understands Forge syntax, naming, and design conventions.

## Context-Aware and Version-Smart

The Forge MCP Server automatically detects the version of Tyler Forge™ installed in your project, giving your AI version-accurate documentation and examples. If no version is found, it defaults to the **latest stable release** included with the server — so your results are always up-to-date and reliable.

## Forge Mode and Prompts

To make things even smoother, we’ve introduced **Forge Mode** — a special [MCP prompt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) configuration designed to optimize AI behavior for Tyler Forge™-specific tasks.  

When you activate `forge_mode`, your AI assistant automatically applies Forge-specific context rules, improving how it interprets design system queries, generates component code, and explains implementation details. It’s the easiest way to make sure your AI stays in sync with Forge’s conventions.

:::tip
Use Forge Mode whenever you’re working on anything Forge-related — it helps your AI _think_ like a Forge developer and sets guidelines for best practices.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the Forge MCP Server takes just a minute.

You can find full installation and configuration instructions for all supported MCP clients, including Claude, Codex, Gemini, and VS Code, at [forge.tylerdev.io](https://forge.tylerdev.io/main/?path=/docs/getting-started-forge-mcp-server--docs).

## What You Can Do

Once connected, your AI gains full access to Forge’s capabilities — from component discovery and documentation retrieval to validation, framework setup guidance, and migration assistance.  

Each capability is declarative and modular, so AI tools can use them intelligently without extra setup or training. The result: smarter, more accurate code suggestions that match Forge standards every time.

## Best Practices

The Forge MCP Server supercharges AI capabilities — just remember to **validate critical output** against the official [Tyler Forge™ documentation](https://forge.tylerdev.io). Be clear and specific with your prompts, and provide context when describing your task — the more the AI knows, the better it performs.
