significant effort. We have documentation, an automated upgrade utility, and resources to help you through the upgrade
process. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on Teams!</p><p>It's very important that we all work together to keep our applications up to date and consistent. Upgrading to the latest
version of Forge is a key part of that effort and the larger Tyler 2030 vision.</p></div></div>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="major-version-updates">Major Version Updates<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#major-version-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Major Version Updates" title="Direct link to Major Version Updates">​</a></h2>
<p>We understand that major version updates can be disruptive, so we wanted to share our plans for future major version
updates to help give you confidence in Forge. We are committed to providing a smooth upgrade path and clear documentation
to make the transition as seamless as possible in future versions.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited or No Breaking Changes</strong>: We will do our best to avoid breaking changes in future major version updates by
instead deprecating features/components and replacing them with a new implementation. If breaking changes are necessary,
we will provide clear guidance on how to migrate your code seamlessly and do our best to provide tooling to automate it
if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-Term Support</strong>: We will provide long-term support for the "current - 1" major versions of Forge. This means that
we will continue to provide bug fixes and security updates for the previous major version for a period of time after a
new major version is released. This will give you more time to upgrade to the latest version without worrying about
missing out on important updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade Guides</strong>: We will provide detailed upgrade guides for each major version update to help you understand what
has changed and how to update your code. These guides will include information on breaking changes (if any), new features,
and best practices to help you make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
</li>

We do not intend
to release a new major version of Forge in 2025. We want to get Forge v3 into the hands of as many developers as possible
and ensure that it meets the needs of our users before we start planning for the next major version to ensure a seamless
upgrade path.</p><p>We want to introduce stability in the Forge ecosystem and ensure that developers can rely on Forge as a long-term solution
without worrying about frustrating breaking changes.</p></div></div>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="forge-extended">Forge Extended<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#forge-extended" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Forge Extended" title="Direct link to Forge Extended">​</a></h2>
<p>We're investing time into extending Forge's capabilities to make it even more powerful, by creating a new library of
composite components that implement common patterns and best practices. This will make it faster and easier to build
complex applications by utilizing larger blocks/components that are already built and tested.</p>
<p>Examples of these types of components might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter Sidesheet</li>
<li>Confirmation Dialog</li>
<li>Side Navigation</li>
<li>Table Header</li>
<li>Responsive Toolbar</li>
<li>... and many more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Any time you find yourself building a component that is a common pattern across applications, you can look to Forge
Extended to see if there is a component that already exists that you can use. If you find that a component is missing,
you can contribute to the Forge Extended library by creating a new component and submitting a pull request.</p>
<p>We believe that this will help developers build applications faster and more efficiently, as well improve consistency
and maintainability across projects. This new library will be built on top of the primitive components that are already
available in Forge v3, and will provide a higher level of abstraction to help you build applications more quickly.</p>
<p>We're excited to share more details about Forge Extended in the coming months, so stay tuned for updates!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="blocks">Blocks<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#blocks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blocks" title="Direct link to Blocks">​</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the new Forge Extended library, we're also planning to introduce a new concept called "Blocks" (formerly
known as "Recipes") to Forge. Blocks are larger sections of UI that can be easily added to your application to by simply
copying and pasting the code. This will allow you to quickly add common patterns and components to your application
without having to build them from scratch, but still provide the flexibility to customize them to fit your needs.</p>
<p>Blocks are made up of both primitive Forge components and native HTML elements + styles, as well as components from the
Forge Extended library, and will provide a more efficient way to build applications allowing developers to get up and
running much more quickly.</p>
<p>Blocks will be available in the Forge documentation and will include detailed instructions on how to use them in your
applications with examples and best practices. We'll release more information about Blocks in the coming months!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="lit-based-components">Lit-based Components<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#lit-based-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lit-based Components" title="Direct link to Lit-based Components">​</a></h2>
<p>We're also investing time into improving the developer experience in Forge by adopting <a href="https://lit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lit</a> as the base for
all new Forge components. Lit is a lightweight library for building web components using modern web standards,
and it provides a simple and efficient way to create reusable components with a framework-like feel.</p>
<p>Forge has always been built as web components, but does not rely on any abstraction libraries or frameworks which
meant we needed to write and maintain more boilerplate code, leading to larger and more inefficient production
bundles. By adopting Lit, we hope to provide a more performant, consistent, and modern development experience for
maintainers and ease the barrier to entry for new contributors.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="new-components">New Components<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#new-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Components" title="Direct link to New Components">​</a></h2>
<p>We're also planning to release a number of new components in 2025 to help fill in some of the gaps that have been
identified by the community.</p>
<p>Some of the components we're planning to release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tree</strong>: A tree component that can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree-like structure with expandable
and collapsible nodes. This component will be highly customizable and provide a flexible way to display complex data
structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meter</strong>: A meter and meter-group component that can be used to represent scalar values within a known range. These
components will provide a simple and flexible way to visualize data in a more intuitive and engaging way. Not to be
confused with linear progress indicators, meters are used to represent a value within a range (such as a gauge or
thermometer), whereas progress indicators are used to represent the completion or busy state of an application task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>: A breadcrumbs component that can be used to display a breadcrumb trail for navigation purposes. This
component will provide a simple and intuitive way to navigate through a hierarchy of pages or sections in your
application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inline Dropdowns</strong>: This is the next evolution of how Forge handles dropdowns. This pattern will allow you to
configure a dropdown declaratively and inline with the flow of your page. Built on top of the new Forge v3 popover,
this will provide a more flexible and developer-friendly way to create your own dropdowns, as well as improve the
ergonomics of existing dropdown-based components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Grid</strong>: A powerful and flexible data grid component that will provide more advanced features than our current
<code>&lt;forge-table&gt;</code> component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Scroller</strong>: A virtual scroller component that can be used to display large lists of items efficiently by
only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="web-features">Web Features<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#web-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Web Features" title="Direct link to Web Features">​</a></h2>
<p>Forge is constantly evolving, and so are the latest web features and APIs. We're always looking for ways to improve the
developer experience and provide new features and components.</p>
<p>This is only more true because Forge is built on top of web components, which are a rapidly evolving standard that
continues to introduce new features and capabilities on a regular basis. We're committed to staying up to date with
the latest web standards and providing you with the tools and components you need to build modern and performant
applications.</p>
<p>Some of the features we're looking at for the future include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Custom States</strong>: This new API is available on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ElementInternals</code></a> interface and allows you to define custom
states for your custom elements. This provides a more efficient and familiar way to use CSS for state-based
customizations via the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>:state(&lt;state name&gt;)</code></a> pseudo-class.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note admonition_xJq3 alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>This will also affect how we reflect certain JavaScript properties to attributes. We will no longer need to
reflect properties to attributes for component state changes, which will improve performance and reduce the amount
of boilerplate code needed to manage state changes within custom elements.</p></div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-root ARIA</strong>: Web components that make use of shadow DOM have always had a challenge with ARIA attributes
that need to be applied to elements outside of the shadow root. The new <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/1086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reference Target proposal</a>
aims to address this issue by providing a way for developers using web components to apply ARIA attributes to the
internals of an element via IDREFs. We're very excited about this proposal and are looking forward to implementing it
in Forge once it's supported in all browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CSS Relative Colors</strong>: This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new syntax</a> is already available in browsers and allows you to define colors
relative to other colors in varying color formats. This will provide a more flexible and powerful way to theme
Forge components and create dynamic color schemes that adapt to different contexts and environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CSS Anchor Positioning</strong>: This is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exciting new feature</a> that will allow us to use pure CSS to position
floating elements around an anchor element. This will provide a more efficient and performant way to create
tooltips, popovers, and other floating elements in Forge without relying on JavaScript for positioning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="state-of-accessibility">State of Accessibility<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2025/02/06/forge-2025#state-of-accessibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to State of Accessibility" title="Direct link to State of Accessibility">​</a></h2>
<p>In 2024 Tyler embarked on a journey to improve the accessibility compliance across all of our applications. This
initiative has been a great success, and we are seeing more and more applications becoming compliant with the
latest accessibility standards.</p>
<p>Automated scanning tools such as ARC Toolkit, Level Access, and Axe have been instrumental in identifying accessibility
issues and guiding developers on how to fix them.</p>
<p>Forge v3 made significant improvements to accessibility by providing better support for screen readers, keyboard
navigation, and other assistive technologies. We are committed to continuing to improve accessibility in Forge and
ensuring that all applications built with Forge are accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://forge.tylertech.com</a> domain will continue to work as before and still require Tyler credentials. This will
allow for us to publish internal content that is only available to Tyler employees, such as case studies, application
demos/screenshots, relevant Confluence and Coda links, ...etc. Navigating to the public Forge website will be quick
and easy from this internal site and can be bookmarked separately for quick access.</p>
<p>We're excited to share the Forge design system with the world, and it will complement the already public and open source
Forge component library perfectly.</p>

<p>We'd like to give a special shout out to the following who have contributed to this release in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sam Richardson:</strong>
We wouldn't have been able to make the progress we did without Sam's tireless work on refactoring many
of the core components such as the text field, checkbox, radio, and switch. Sam is also responsible for
many of the accessibility improvements that have been made in this release, and we're extremely grateful
for his hard work. Sam has been a key contributor to Forge for many years, and we're lucky to have him on
the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paul Lapczynski &amp; Derek Moss</strong>
Documentation is always the most tedious and last thing to get done, but it's one of the most important
aspects of any software project. Paul and Derek volunteered to help rebuild the Forge Storybook documentation
site, and I'm sure I can speak for them in saying that it was no small task. They did an amazing job, and we're
hoping this new documentation site will be a valuable resource for developers going forward. More improvements
to come!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rob Sturgill &amp; Tyler McGowan:</strong>
Rob and Tyler were extremely helpful in the early stages of the theming and typography updates, as well as the
introduction of design tokens. They directly influenced many of the great changes that were introduced in these
areas, and were key to the success of these improvements.</p>
<p>Rob also maintains the Forge Figma library for designers, and he has been keeping it up to date with the latest
changes as 3.0 has progressed so that our designers and developers can stay in sync.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nick Andrews, Paul Lapczynski, Ross Blakeney, Jonathan Earl, and Rob Jacobs:</strong>
These folks volunteered to help test various preview builds of Forge 3.0, and their feedback was invaluable
in helping us identify and fix issues before the final release. Bugs in software are inevitable, but the work
of these folks helped us to catch many of them early on.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these folks, we'd also like to thank the Forge governance committees for their feedback on various
design and implementation decisions that were made in this release. We're hoping to strengthen the governance
process around Forge in the coming weeks, and we're looking forward to getting more folks involved in the
decision making process.</p>

<p>We've made a concerted effort to improve the accessibility of Forge components. This effort included
a full audit of our components, many structural adjustments, and a focus on ensuring that all components
come with the necessary ARIA attributes and keyboard interactions while still allowing for customization
by developers when necessary.</p>
<p>Accessibility is going to be a key focus for all of Tyler in the coming months, and we want to make sure that
everyone who uses Forge can do so with confidence that is is accessible to all users. The accessibility
landscape is vast and complex, and we're committed to making sure that we're doing our part to make it
easier for developers to build accessible applications.</p>

<p>We've removed our dependency on Material in this release. This was a big step for us, and it allowed us
to make many improvements to the library that we wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. We're excited
to see how this change will allow us to move forward with new features and improvements in the future.</p>

<p>The Forge theming system was lacking in many ways, partially due to the Material dependency. With the
removal of Material, we are now able to provide Forge-named CSS variables for theming, and the core
theming system across all components has been refactored for deep integration with these design tokens.</p>

<p>We've introduced a uniform typography scale and a few new variations on our type styles. This should help
give your design more consistency, and reduce confusion when choosing the right type style for your content.</p>

<p>Design tokens are a new concept for Forge, and they are a key part of the theming and typography systems,
among other things. Design tokens are a way to define the core/primitive design values of our visual
design language in a way that can be shared across all components and design tools. This will allow us to
make changes to our design language in a more consistent and maintainable way between design and development.</p>
<p>Design tokens allow for consistent design across all components, while enabling branding and customization
flexibility for those that need it without having to modify the core components. This is a big step forward
for Forge, and we're excited to see how it can be utilized!</p>

<p>Previous versions of Forge had a single state that was used for both focus and interaction feedback. This
was implemented following Material's "ripple" pattern. In this release, we've separated these states to allow for
the focus state to act as a "ring" around the element, while the interaction state can be a more subtle effect
when hovered and pressed. This separation allows for improved accessibility and a more clear delineation between
focus and interaction states.</p>

<p>One of the initial driving factors for this release was to improve the usage patterns of various Forge components.
The web is an ever evolving platform, and we want to make sure that Forge components are keeping up with the latest
features and best practices.</p>

<p>The Forge list and list item components are core to many applications, and we've made some updates to ensure that
the can be used in a more accessible way, while still allowing for the flexibility that developers need.</p>

<p>The Forge dialog component has been completely rebuilt from scratch in this release. We've made many improvements
to the component, most notably in how it uses the native <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://forge.tylerdev.io/main/?path=/docs/components-dialog--docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dialog</a> docs for more information.</p>

<p>The Forge button, icon button, and floating action button components have been updated to use a new HTML structure.
This new structure removes the need to supply a native <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element as a child of the component. In addition
to this, the API for these components has been altered slightly to make them more consistent and easier to use.</p>
<p>Much the same as buttons, the Forge form control components checkbox, radio, and switch have been rewritten from the
ground up and no longer require a native <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element as a child. These elements will continue to participate
in HTML forms as expected.</p>
<p>These components themselves become the interactive and semantic elements, and this is a step in the right direction
for improving Forge and making it easier to use.</p>

<p>Alright, let's get to the details! We've done our best to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible,
but there are some breaking changes that you should be aware of. We've documented the process on the Forge
GitHub wiki, and we're here to help if you run into any issues.</p>

<p>The Forge upgrade utility has been revamped to help you migrate your application to Forge 3.0. We know that
upgrading to a new version of a UI library can be a daunting task, and we wanted to make an attempt at improving
this process. The upgrade utility for Forge 3.0 is designed to help you automate as much of the upgrade process
as possible.</p>

<p>With the release of Forge 3.0, we're also announcing the end of life for TCW 1.x effective as of 6/10/2024. We know that many
of you have been using TCW 1.x for a long time, and we know it's not a trivial task to upgrade to Forge 3.0. TCW 1.x was a step in
the right direction, but it has many limitations and core flaws, and we've addressed many (if not all) of these between
Forge 2.x and 3.x.</p>
<p><strong>Please try to get an upgrade plan in place on your roadmap as soon as possible.</strong></p>

<p>Forge 2.x will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future, but we will not be adding any new features or

<p>We want to eventually reach the point where we can push out new features and improvements to Forge on a more regular
basis without breaking your code. The faster we can get everyone on the same version, the faster we can achieve this
goal.</p>

<p>As we continue to evolve Forge, we have a few key goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solidify APIs, usage patterns, and implementation to reduce breaking changes in future versions. We want to get
to a point where you can upgrade Forge easily with confidence that your application will continue to work as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve accessibility across all components. This is a key focus for us, and we want to make sure that all Forge
components are accessible to all users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce new components and features that make it easier to build applications with Forge. We're always looking
for ways to improve the developer experience, and we're excited to see what new features we can introduce in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate a strong community around Forge. We want to make sure that developers have the resources they need to
build amazing applications with Forge, and we're always open to contribution and feedback from the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We know many of you have been waiting a long time for this release, and we're extremely grateful for your patience
and support. We had originally intended for this project to be released much sooner, but due to the complexity of
the changes that were made, many roadblocks along the way, and the sheer amount of work that needed to be done, we
ended up taking a bit longer but we're extremely happy with where we ended up.</p>
<p>We hope the upgrade process goes smoothly for you, and we're here to help if you run into any issues. We're excited
to see what you build with Forge 3.0, and we're looking forward to sharing more updates with you in the coming months!</p>
<p>Alright, that's all for now. Thanks for reading, and happy coding! 🚀</p>]]></content>

be removed or deprecated. We are looking to sunset TCW 1.x when Forge 3.0 is released. Early adopters are
welcome to try Forge 3.0. Stay tuned for more updates!</p></div></div>

<p>Before we answer the burning question that everyone has been asking about regarding the release date for Forge
3.0, let's discuss <em>why</em> we're creating this version and how everyone will benefit from it.</p>
<p>Let's first take a look at where we came from to help frame where we're going:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tcw-1x">TCW 1.x<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2024/04/02/forge-3-coming-soon#tcw-1x" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TCW 1.x" title="Direct link to TCW 1.x">​</a></h3>
<p>The first iteration of Forge components. It was initially a very strict set of UI components that didn't allow
for much visual flexibility, it needed to support IE 11 and ES5, and it was the first pass for Tyler as a
company to try to align on a design system to improve our consistency and cohesiveness across products. It worked,
it had its shortcomings, but it was a great step in the right direction and served as a learning experience for everyone.</p>

<p>This was a stepping stone version that was all about rebranding from TCW to Forge so that we have an official
implementation for our design system. We understand that it was a disruption for everyone to have to migrate from
TCW to Forge, along with the various breaking API changes we introduced during that effort. We're focusing more on
the types of breaking changes we introduce this time around. We had many more plans/ideas we wanted to introduce with
2.0, but we decided to defer those to a future release.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="forge-30">Forge 3.0<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2024/04/02/forge-3-coming-soon#forge-30" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Forge 3.0" title="Direct link to Forge 3.0">​</a></h3>
<p>Fast forward to today and we're on to that next phase. Forge 3.0 is a modernization of the library with a deep focus on
accessibility, design tokens, and developer usage pattern updates to take advantage of new browser APIs. This version
completes most of the plans we envisioned for Forge 2.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-forge-30">What is Forge 3.0?<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2024/04/02/forge-3-coming-soon#what-is-forge-30" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Forge 3.0?" title="Direct link to What is Forge 3.0?">​</a></h2>
<p>At a high level, Forge 3.0 is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer directly depends on Material</li>
<li>Fixes critical accessibility issues</li>
<li>Allows for inline usage of “floating” elements (tooltips, dialogs, popovers... etc.)</li>
<li>Introduces design tokens to better support branding requirements</li>
<li>Fixes the core theming system</li>
<li>Provides a new and improved typography scale</li>
<li>Separates the focus state from the interaction&nbsp;(hover, pressed) states</li>
<li>Removes unnecessary global styles</li>
<li>Reduces and improves setup requirements</li>
<li>Pays down technical debt</li>
<li>Uses modern browser APIs</li>
<li>Improves performance</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about these items will be provided in the full 3.0 upgrade guide to come upon release, but these changes affect every
component in the library in one way or another.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we are trying to better support backwards compatibility as much as we can this time around. This means that
certain components and APIs are going to be deprecated in favor of new patterns with a plan to remove them in a future version.
Hopefully this will allow you to upgrade to 3.0 without it causing a major disruption and gradually update your applications on your
own timeline.</p>
<p>We will also be updating the Forge upgrade utility with any necessary automation that we can provide to assist (as well as making
it easier to install/use). There will of course be some breaking changes as with any major version release, but we're doing our best
to reduce the upgrade friction as much as we can.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="when-will-forge-30-be-released">When will Forge 3.0 be released?<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2024/04/02/forge-3-coming-soon#when-will-forge-30-be-released" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When will Forge 3.0 be released?" title="Direct link to When will Forge 3.0 be released?">​</a></h2>
<p>We've been intentionally quiet on this topic due to delays, resourcing, and unexpected road blocks that just took more time to solve
than we anticipated... We didn't want to commit to a timeline that we couldn't deliver on, and while we don't have an exact release
date to announce, we are getting very close to being done. We are looking for early adopters that are willing to use Forge 3.0 and help
us work out any final kinks and finalize the upgrade utility.</p>

<p>We still have a lot more work to do before release to sweep various changes across the library, testing, updating documentation,
and sweeping the framework adapter libraries. Things should come together fairly quickly over the next few weeks to a month so stay
tuned for another announcement!</p>

<p>Forge 3.0 opens the door for many new components &amp; patterns to be built, and providing new patterns for using existing components.
Various components have already been refactored to utilize these new tools/patterns, where others will require more careful planning
and research first.</p>
<p>For example, now that we can reliably provide inline usage of the <code>&lt;forge-popover&gt;</code> (renders above everything else, but lives in the
DOM where it is defined), we have the ability to re-imagine elements such as the <code>&lt;forge-select&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;forge-menu&gt;</code> (any element that
presents a dropdown essentially) so that developers are no longer required to use JavaScript to provide custom content! This is something
we are very excited about, and while it won't make it into the initial 3.0 release due to time constraints, we are planning to provide
these new components in a feature release later this year.</p>
<p>While building 3.0 we have already started to gather a list of items that would make sense for a 4.0 release. These are things that would
either be too much of a disruption to the ecosystem to introduce right now, or because we're waiting on new browser APIs to allow us
to provide a better implementation in the future. If you have any ideas, please feel free to pass them along!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we move more and more toward responsive design there has been increasing interest in CSS container queries. For those of us who aren’t on the cutting edge of CSS development, container queries are a new feature that allows us to apply styles based on a containing element’s dimensions. This is conceptually similar to typical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media queries</a>, which are based instead on the qualities of the viewport as a whole.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how container queries can make developing flexible layouts easier. The classic demonstration is a single card component that renders differently based on where it is on the page. There’s been enough written on it before that there's no need to repeat here, but check out <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/say-hello-to-css-container-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this older but still relevant example</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/complete-guide-css-container-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this writeup in Smashing Magazine</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN’s docs</a> for great, in-depth examples.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to start incorporating container queries into your code. However, this is still a very recent addition to browsers (supported in Firefox as of February 2023 and other major browsers from September 2022) so it’s smart to set a fallback for users still on older versions.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>ForgeResizeObserver</code> as that fallback. <code>ForgeResizeObserver</code> is a performant utility written around the native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resize_Observer_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resize Observer API</a> that notifies us whenever an observed element’s dimensions change.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t, we pass in the the container element and register it with the ResizeObserver, setting up a callback function to toggle a class on it when it crosses our breakpoint. Be sure to import <code>ForgeResizeObserver</code> from <code>@tylertech/forge-core</code>.</p>

<p>To avoid memory leaks it’s necessary to clean up the ResizeObserver when the targeted element leaves the DOM. This is simple if your app uses Angular, just call <code>ForgeResizeObserver.unobserve()</code> in your component’s ngOnDestroy lifecycle method.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Angular framework does a "pretty good" job of working with Web Components out of the box, but having to use <code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code> weakens template type-checking overall, can mask errors, and doesn't provide any autocomplete or IntelliSense.  As of v2.1.0 of the <code>@tylertech/forge-angular</code> library, however, released in November 2022, it's no longer necessary to specify the schema, and if you import the associated modules, Forge components can be used as though they were Angular components!</p>

<p>There are a few moving parts, but the piece that actually enables the integration are Angular <code>@Component()</code> definitions that mirror the Forge Web Components without introducing any new DOM elements, which we're calling Proxy Components.  They provide just enough definition for Angular to recognize the component, and then do everything they can to get out of the way.  These components are all generated, so they can be more automatically kept up to date.  We'll get into more detail about how that works later on in this post.  Here's a simple example of a proxy component:</p>

<p>As you can see by the selector, the Forge web component itself <em>is</em> the Angular component.  It has an <code>@Input()</code> for each public property of the Forge component, and a public method for each public method of the component.  And that's basically it.  It mirrors the types directly from the Forge type definitions, along with any JSDoc, and minimizes Angular's footprint by calling <code>runOutsideAngular</code> and <code>changeDetectorRef.detach()</code> along with <code>onPush</code> change detection.</p>
<p>Note also the boolean coercion for the <code>density</code> property, so that <code>dense="true"</code> or even just <code>dense</code> still works and you don't need <code>[dense]="true"</code>. The intention is that a template that was valid with <code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code> should also work without it using the proxy components.</p>
<p>You may wonder why there aren't any <code>@Output()</code> properties, but they're actually not necessary at all because the Forge library provides typings for <code>HTMLElementEventMap</code>.  This means that they're already strongly typed and support auto-suggest, and since Angular has built-in support for native events, it's better to treat them as such because it supports bubbling.  The way Forge was already working was optimal, so we didn't want the proxy components to get in the way.</p>
<p>Lastly, the component constructor invokes the <code>defineRadioComponent()</code> method, removing the need to call that explicitly in the application.  In the most recent version, this is also done in the module constructor, to account for components that are rendered dynamically, e.g. by calling <code>document.createElement('forge-button')</code>.  Prior to v2.5.0, that would still require the application to ensure the custom element is defined.  We have also added these <code>define</code> calls to singleton services that show Forge components, such as <code>DialogService</code> and <code>ToastService</code>.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should be able to import the necessary modules for components in your templates (e.g. <code>ForgeRadioModule</code>), remove <code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code> and the <code>define***Element()</code> calls, and it will just work.  Or if there are any compilation errors, they'll represent actual issues with the correctness of the template.  As we've rolled this out in a number of apps, it has certainly turned up a number of very real defects that were obscured by <code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code>, but for the most part required very few changes.  The most common case where stricter typing caused a problem was providing an object to a boolean property, essentially using whether it was defined to determine truthiness, which can be coerced using <code>!!</code>.  Angular also allows the use of <code>$any()</code> to override usages that may not satisfy TypeScript, but you know are correct and want to defer or avoid changing them at the current time.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is usually to go module-by-module, remove <code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code>, and import the modules for each Forge web component used in the templates of components until they compile.  Then remove the <code>define***Element()</code> calls.</p>
<p>In Forge 2.0 we decided to make this entirely opt-in, to prevent upgrading a minor version of the <code>forge-angular</code> from behaving like a breaking change with stricter type-checking.  So, where the <code>forge-angular</code> library already provides modules for value accesor directives, for now you'll need to import a separate <code>Forge*ProxyModule</code> for those components.  In the future, most likley Forge 3.0, we intend to combine these so you get both the Proxy Component and value accesor in the same module.</p>
<p>Also, as much as possible, we've tried to roll up components that are always used together into the parent module.  For example, if you import <code>ForgeListModule</code>, it will provide proxy components for both <code>&lt;forge-list&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;forge-list-item&gt;</code>.  This is purely intended as a conveninence, and <code>ForgeListItemModule</code> still exists independently.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>ProxyComponentsModule</code> that includes all proxy components, similar to how <code>ForgeModule</code> contains all the value accessor modules.  Importing individual modules will provide better tree-shaking and is preferred, but if you were already using the roll-up module this will provide a similar experience in cases where the optimization isn't necessary.</p>
<p>Consider the following template from the <code>forge-angular</code> demo app, which will not need to change at all.:</p>

<p>Note that we had to import both <code>ForgeSelectModule</code> and <code>ForgeSelectProxyModule</code>, and also that we did not need to import <code>ForgeOptionModule</code> for the <code>&lt;forge-option&gt;</code> usages because the <code>ForgeSelectModule</code> already re-exports that.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the components could be kept up to date with the latest changes in Forge with minimal effort, the components are generated using the Angular Schematics in the <a href="https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-schematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>forge-schematics</code></a> repository.  For the most part, the process of updating <code>forge-angular</code> to reflect changes in <code>forge</code> is just:</p>

<p>This will update existing components, generate proxy components for any new ones added (such as the recent <code>forge-split-view</code>) and even create modules where they don't exist.  For new components, it's currently still a manual process to update <code>index.ts</code> files and add them to <code>ProxyComponentsModule</code>.  It may also be desirable to add a demo to the app in order to exercise the types and showcase their usage.  Eventually we may automate the creation of a PR when new versions of Forge are published.</p>
<p>If you want to add an additional relationship to have one component's module export another as a convenience, such as only needing to import <code>ForgeSplitViewModule</code> and also be able to automatically use <code>forge-split-view-panel</code> in your template, these can be configured in the <code>generate-proxies.json</code> file, before running the above command, by adding to <code>componentDependencies</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see from the configuration options, the schematic itself is fairly generic, and may work with other Web Component libraries besides Forge.  It does assume certain conventions are followed, such as the use of TypeScript and specifically <code>HTMLElementEventMap</code> typings, but could probably be modified with additional options if the need ever arose.  The most essential metadata the schematic relies on, however, is a JSON file now published by the Forge library known as a Custom Elements Manifest.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-custom-elements-manifest">The Custom Elements Manifest<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/03/22/angular-proxies#the-custom-elements-manifest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Custom Elements Manifest" title="Direct link to The Custom Elements Manifest">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Elements Manifest</a> represents an effort to standardize on a common, machine-readable specification to describe custom elements. The schema is written in TypeScript and compiled to JSON Schema.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest#framework-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework Integration</a> is a documented use case for consuming such a manifest. The example cited is automating the creation of wrapper components for React, but here we're using it for Angular.  This schema could also be used to generate documentation of attributes, slots, events, and other features of Web Components in Storybook or the Forge website that currently require a lot of manual effort to keep up to date.  There's also an existing plugin for the analyzer for creating React wrappers based on the manifest, which might be of interest to React developers here at Tyler.</p>
<p>The manifest is automatically generated as part of the build using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-elements-manifest/analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>@custom-elements-manifest/analyzer</code></a> and included in the published npm package.</p>
<p>For the Angular component generation to work, the only requirement is that the tag name for each custom element be specified in the JSDoc for the component class:</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The split view component arrived with Forge 2.9.0 a few months ago, finally giving us a way to develop resizable layouts without relying on third party libraries.

<p>You can get a split view on the screen with as little code as this:</p>

<p>This creates the default view — a two panel layout arranged horizontally.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Basic split view without content example" src="https://forge.tylertech.com/assets/images/split_view_basic-d98d9a19a80a3c99e9aa732284f60792.png" width="2018" height="1290" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This already looks promising. Just like that you get two content areas and a handle dividing them. Click on the handle (notice the slick ripple animation) and drag it around to change the relative size of the panels.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to differentiate the panels like this, though, so let's add in some content. While we're at it let's also make the right panel take up half the available space, up from the default 200 pixels.</p>

<p>It's important to note that in this example only the right panel should be thought of as resizable. We'll get more into this later on, but for now know that by default the first panel automatically expands to fill the space left by its explicitly-sized siblings. If you need the left panel to resize instead you can use the <code>resizable</code> attribute to manually configure this.</p>

<p>Without <code>resizable</code> set the split view assumes that the first panel isn't resizable and sets it for you. You may not have to mess with this very often, but when you do remember that at least one panel in any split view layout <em>must</em> have <code>resizable</code> set to off.</p>

<p>This is a nice layout to use when you're designing for a screen that's taller than it is wide, e.g. a phone. Get responsive and use a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media query</a> to track the browser's viewport size, switching between horizontal and vertical orientations on the fly to deliver the best experience.</p>

<p>When you resize a panel in a setup like this it can only expand up to the point where the neighboring panel is as small as possible. So if you were to drag the right panel's handle in this example, the middle panel could shrink down to a width of zero pixels or expand to fill both panel's space but the left panel won't ever change size.</p>
<p>This also works in a vertical layout, of course.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="constraining-sizes">Constraining sizes<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/10/split-view-component#constraining-sizes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Constraining sizes" title="Direct link to Constraining sizes">​</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you don't want to give the user complete control over the size of your content. Maybe, as responsive as you were able to make your design, something just breaks when it gets too big or too small.</p>
<p>For cases like that we have the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes. Each takes a pixel amount or percentage and ensures that the panel it's set on will never resize past that boundary.</p>
<p>This code constrains the right panel to a width between 100 pixels and two thirds the width of the split view:</p>

<p>It's not always enough to simply minimize content. You may also want to give users the ability to completely hide a panel from view. Imagine you have something like a document viewer beside your other content. It's nice to be able to scale the viewer to your preferred size, but it doesn't make sense to have it up at all when nothing's open in it.</p>
<p>The <code>open</code> attribute is there to solve this problem. Set it to <code>true</code> to keep a panel visible, or <code>false</code> to hide it away with a quick animation (just like the Forge drawer component).</p>

<p>The right panel here has its <code>open</code> attribute set to <code>false</code> and so is hidden from the view and assistive technology.</p>
<p>Panels can also be configured to close automatically when they reach a certain size. Set <code>auto-close</code> to <code>true</code> to enable this at zero pixels, and <code>auto-close-threshold</code> to your desired pixel threshold if it differs.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-it-works">How it works<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/10/split-view-component#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it works" title="Direct link to How it works">​</a></h2>
<p>At its heart the split view component is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flex</a> container with some extra logic to manage communication between its children. Panels with <code>resizable</code> set to <code>off</code> grow and shrink to fill space simply because they have their CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>flex</code></a> property set to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Other panels have their widths explicitly set via JavaScript. When a user begins resizing, the panel get its size and the initial pointer location. As the pointer moves the initial and updated locations are continually compared to produce a delta value which is then added to the starting size to produce the new size.</p>
<p>Typically computations involving rapid reads and write to the DOM are expensive because they trigger reflows affecting every element on the page. The split view attempts to improve performance by doing the necessary reads at the beginning of the process and delaying other calculations until the resize has ended. It also makes use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>contain</code></a> CSS property to restrict how much of the page is involved in reflows that do happen.</p>
<p>When a resize has ended, the affected panel signals its siblings to recalculate their properties via their parent split view.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="accessibility">Accessibility<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/10/split-view-component#accessibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Accessibility" title="Direct link to Accessibility">​</a></h2>
<p>The single point of interaction for each split view panel is its handle. This is the element that, aside from being draggable via mouse, receives keyboard focus and provides the panel's semantic information.</p>
<p>The semantics piece is why it's important to understand which handle controls each panel and by extension which panels are resizable (calling back to the beginning of the post). Each panel <strong>must</strong> be labelled to properly expose it to assistive technology. We do that with the <code>accessible-label</code> attribute, which sets the interior <code>aria-label</code> property of the handle:</p>

The only reason they were omitted up until this point was for readability.</p></div></div>
<p>The label should be a short and simple description of the panel's content. Think of it as another heading on the page. In one of the previous examples we might have set it to "Document viewer". Note that there's no need to include the word "panel", "handle" or anything like that.</p>
<p>Also note that the left panel doesn't have a label. This is because it is not resizable, which means it doesn't have a handle and therefore doesn't provide any semantic information. Even if you did set a label, it would never make it to the DOM anyway.</p>
<p>With this in mind you might see why we'd choose one panel to be resizable over another. It's often the secondary, "aside" or "detail" content that makes more sense as resizing. Whether that ends up on the left, right, top, or bottom is up to you.</p>
<p>There are other accessible attributes set on the handle as well, though most developers will never have much need the think about them here. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>role=separator</code></li>
<li><code>aria-orientation</code>, either <code>vertical</code> or <code>horizontal</code></li>
<li><code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuemax</code>, and <code>aria-valuenow</code></li>
<li><code>aria-grabbed</code>, reflecting whether it's currently being dragged</li>
<li><code>aria-controls</code> pointing to the content element</li>
</ul>
<p>These attributes, and more interesting things about this sort of component, are detailed in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/separator_role" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN's docs on the separator role</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="keyboard-interaction">Keyboard interaction<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/10/split-view-component#keyboard-interaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Keyboard interaction" title="Direct link to Keyboard interaction">​</a></h3>
<p>To empower screen reader users and anyone who prefers to navigate with their keyboard, all the functionality of the split view component is available through keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>When a panel's handle is focused the arrow keys will expand or collapse it (faster if combined with the shift key) and the home and end keys minimize and maximize it, respectively. This is all pretty straightforward so far.</p>
<p>There's one more shortcut available but you'll have to enable it manually — set the <code>allow-close</code> property and a press of the enter/return key will close the panel. As noted before, if a panel closes there's no built-in UI to reopen it, so don't forget to account for that in your design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="customization">Customization<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/10/split-view-component#customization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Customization" title="Direct link to Customization">​</a></h2>
<p>Most of the split view component's appearance is defined by the content you place in it. Its only obvious UI element is the handle between panels. That said, each internal element has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part selector</a> to allow you to style it however you want.</p>
<p>The split view itself only exposes one part, <code>root</code>.</p>
<p>The panel has a few more:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code>: The container element.</li>
<li><code>handle</code>: The handle element.</li>
<li><code>icon</code>: The icon <em>inside</em> the handle element.</li>
<li><code>ripple</code>: The ripple that activates when the handle is interacted with.</li>
<li><code>content</code>: The container around the content you slot in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other day I was working on an app and wanted to switch up how my split view looked. I ended up writing this bit of SCSS:</p>

<p>This snippet sets height and width variables based on the split view's orientation then uses those to turn the icon element into a little pill shape.</p>

<p>A lot of hard work went into developing the split view component to be as robust, accessible, and developer friendly as possible. As more teams start to use it we're looking forward to seeing what new kinds of layouts and user interactions it enables.

        <updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the new and improved Forge design system website!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new and improved Forge design system website!</p>
<p>This is the first step toward a larger goal of open sourcing the design system so that it is publicly accessible. We are hoping to share the great work
that the Forge team has done with the public community, as well as provide a design system to go along with our open source Forge Web Component library.</p>
<p>In this first release of the new website, we have largely kept the content the same, although we have reorganized it, improved naming conventions, and audited the content to correct our guidance. However, we expect to continue refining this design documentation, including deprecating content, moving content to locations outside of the design docs, and adding entirely new content.</p>
<p>Below we highlight what to expect with this update.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="landing-page-and-navigation">Landing page and navigation<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#landing-page-and-navigation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Landing page and navigation" title="Direct link to Landing page and navigation">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the first changes you'll notice is to the landing page and navigation structure of the website, from the top-level through to the organization of individual pages. These changes implement a new information architecture that make it easier to locate content and to show how different elements in the design system relate to each other.</p>
<p>For example, in the <code>/Components</code> section of the website, we have added component categories to group components by purpose or use. Previously, those components were presented in a single alphabetical list. In the new information architecture, it is easier to find a component or set of components based on the problem they are intended to solve.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="get-started">Get started<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Get started" title="Direct link to Get started">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the key sections of the new website is <code>/Get started</code>, where we have consolidated the content previously grouped under "Core components" or "Core patterns". This new section provides product teams a single starting point for answering the question, "At a minimum, what does a Forge application include?" Moreover, this section provides a logical grouping for content, like typography, colors, branding, and icons that don't neatly fit into either a "components" or "patterns" category.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="development-docs">Development docs<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#development-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development docs" title="Direct link to Development docs">​</a></h2>
<p>As Forge grows and matures, we needed to change how we surface development documentation to our users. Previously we had development details embedded directly
in the Forge design system website. This was great for our users, but it falls down quickly when there are multiple versions of our component library and made
it very difficult from a maintenance perspective.</p>
<p>We were faced with this problem and needed to quickly determine how to best surface these important details. Our options were to either build a content versioning
system into our website, or link out to external documentation and keep the design system focused on, well, design. We opted to go for the latter which introduces
a distributed content model.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="distributed-content-model">Distributed content model<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#distributed-content-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Distributed content model" title="Direct link to Distributed content model">​</a></h3>
<p>As you've likely already noticed and used, we have moved developer documentation details and demos to Storybook. This tool was designed for component libraries to
show live demos of components alongside API and usage documentation. This now allows for us to provide versioned component library documentation, and link to it
from the design system.</p>
<p>We will continue to follow this format as Forge continues to grow!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tooling">Tooling<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#tooling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tooling" title="Direct link to Tooling">​</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that our website received a face lift, along with some new features! We learned over the past few years that maintaining
design system guidance and content can be daunting task, along with the task of maintaining various website features such as search, navigation,
layout, ...etc. In an effort to reduce our maintenance overhead and focus more on the content you need, we have made the decision to switch from
a custom solution built with Gatsby to a configuration-based solution called <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="docusaurus">Docusaurus<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#docusaurus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Docusaurus" title="Direct link to Docusaurus">​</a></h3>
<p>We believe that moving to Docusaurus will not only allow us to focus on what matters most, design system guidance and content, but also
enable us to make use of its great built-in features that will only provide benefits to our users that we were unable to provide without significant
effort in our old Gatsby-based solution.</p>
<p>A quote from the Docusaurus docs:</p>
<blockquote class="forge-blockquote">
<p>Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, focus on your content and just write Markdown files.
Docusaurus has many great benefits, but below are just a few that we'd like to highlight:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removes the need to build the website from scratch (aka site layout, navigation, search... etc.). It’s generated for us instead based on file structure and configuration.</li>
<li>Supports markdown and MDX, as well as custom React components</li>
<li>N-level navigation (supporting our new IA)</li>
<li>Fully theme-able</li>
<li>Content versioning</li>
<li>Localization</li>
<li>Built-in blogging functionality</li>
<li>Built-in full-text search</li>
<li>Supports headless CMS integration</li>
<li>We <strong>build less</strong> and <strong>focus more on content</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="design">Design<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design" title="Direct link to Design">​</a></h3>
<p>You'll notice if you inspect the site that we're no longer "eating our down dog food" if you will. This means that the site is no longer built with Forge components. We have learned
that Forge was not necessarily designed for building documentation websites, and although we certainly can, we'd prefer that folks use our guidance content to drive their design
decisions instead of using the documentation website itself. This allows us to tailor our website toward being great for providing documentation instead of being an example
of enterprise application design.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="search">Search<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#search" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Search" title="Direct link to Search">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>We have heard you!</strong> The search functionality in the old Gatsby-based Forge website was mediocre at best... Docusaurus provides various built-in search options for us, and we are happy to announce that we now offer a much improved full-text search function. Give it a try in the header above!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="blog">Blog<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#blog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blog" title="Direct link to Blog">​</a></h3>
<p>We have struggled in the past with keeping our users up to date with the happenings of Forge, and we want to improve that. A blog is natural way to allow for us to make announcements,
and provide detailed information to you in a consistent location that you already use. We intend to use this blog section you're viewing right now to keep you up to date with everything from design to development as Forge grows and improves.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this is a conversion/translation from our old website to our new and improved one. This is just the first step as we look forward to open sourcing the design system</p>
<p>Before we are able to do that, we have a few things need to take care of:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="audit-our-content">Audit our content<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#audit-our-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Audit our content" title="Direct link to Audit our content">​</a></h3>
<p>There are portions of the Forge design system that we need to keep private, or things that just may not be valuable for people outside of Tyler to see. We need to audit
the website and determine what content needs to be kept private to Tyler employees.</p>

<p>In an effort to keep the Forge ecosystem easy to navigate, we are looking into how to best surface everything Forge-related to Tyler employees, while still supporting our
new distributed content model. This is where the concept of a Forge "hub" comes in. This hub of sorts will live in what is now forge.tylertech.com, but it may look a bit
different. We're hoping to surface everything that you need to build Tyler applications here, and curating separate websites into a singular location that makes it easy
to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p>More to come on this soon!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="open-source">Open source<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2023/02/03/forge-website-redesign#open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open source" title="Direct link to Open source">​</a></h3>
<p>Releasing our design system to the open source community also means we need to host the website publicly. We intend to secure a new domain for this public version of Forge,
while allowing contribution from both Tyler employees and the public open source community.</p>
<p>An important thing to highlight about open sourcing, is that our contribution process becomes much easier. We have some answers to more easily allow non-technical folks to
provide contributions to the design system content. More to come on this one as well in the future!</p>]]></content>

<p>Welcome to the TCW/Forge upgrade guide! If you're looking for information about how to upgrade from TCW v1.x to Forge 2.0, you've
come to the right place.</p>
<p>With the next generation version of Tyler Components Web (TCW) now being generally available, you probably have a lot of
questions about how to upgrade, what is happening with the previous version, what has changed... etc. This guide is intended
to walk you through the process of upgrading your applications and libraries, and answer all of the questions above and much more.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="rebranding">Rebranding<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#rebranding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rebranding" title="Direct link to Rebranding">​</a></h2>
<p>The most important part of this upgrade is to understand that the TCW project is being <strong>rebranded</strong> as "Forge" components! (aka Forge 2.0)</p>
<p>TCW as it stands today is being <strong>deprecated</strong> and <strong>replaced</strong> with a new Forge-branded version of the library. You can think of Forge 2.0
as the next generation evolution of the TCW library.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info admonition_xJq3 alert alert--info"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>Essentially <code>@tylertech/tyler-components-web</code> is being replaced with an equivalent package called <code>@tylertech/forge</code></p></div></div>
<p>This likely doesn't come as a surprise to most, given that's how many have referred to the project over the years anyway. But,
the main reason for this rebrand is to better align ourselves with our open source goals, and ensure that the library is more
tightly coupled with our Forge design system. This coupling will help ensure that we can these projects are more closely related,
and make it feel more cohesive going forward.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, this means that our naming convention across the library is changing from anything <code>tcw</code> or <code>tyl</code>-related,
to be just <code>forge</code>. More information about that below.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-the-need-for-a-new-version">Why the need for a new version?<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#why-the-need-for-a-new-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why the need for a new version?" title="Direct link to Why the need for a new version?">​</a></h2>
<p>This is an excellent question, and one we went back and forth on for quite some time before deciding a proper path forward.</p>
<p>Let's start with a little history about TCW. The project started in May of 2017. It has taken on various forms over that
period of time, and <strong>a lot</strong> has been changed and been learned. Not only did we need to support legacy browsers like IE 11
at the time, we also had to compile our code to ES5 and make use of legacy polyfills for Web Component browser support.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 5 years and we have now found ourselves maintaining a library that was built for the past, has inconsistencies
in naming conventions and APIs, poorly structured components, and is unable to upgrade important internal dependencies for a
number of reasons. We also do not need to support ES5 or require the use of slow polyfills as Web Components are widely
supported in all modern browsers.</p>
<p>At a high level, the items below are the most important reasons for this new version:</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>View details</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><ul>
<li>
<p>Drop support for IE 11. We now support all latest versions of modern browsers.</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Minimum browser support</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><ul>
<li>Google Chrome: <code>Version 54+</code></li>
<li>Firefox: <code>Version 63+</code></li>
<li>Safari: <code>Version 10.1+</code></li>
<li>Opera: <code>Version 64+</code></li>
<li>Edge (Chromium): <code>Version 79+</code></li>
<li>Internet Explorer: <code>Not supported without downleveling JavaScript to ES5 and using polyfills</code></li>
</ul></div></div></details>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop support for ES5. Our minimum build target is now ES8 (ES2017).</p>
<ul>
<li>This helps improve performance and bundle sizes in downstream applications, and allows us to use newer, more modern browser APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the need for slow polyfills. No more <code>@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs</code> dependencies in your apps!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade our internal version of MDC from version 4 to version 13 (yes, we were that far behind) to support Sass modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>The upgrade to support Sass modules requires a breaking change (this was actually reason #1 for the new version initially).</li>
<li>This also allows for us to take advantage of new features and designs that have been released since version 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce consistent naming conventions and APIs across the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactor various components (that previously encapsulated multiple variants) into separate components to allow for easier maintenance and more obvious usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare ourselves for the release of the Forge component library to the public open source community!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve our theming system to make theme customizations easier and more straightforward.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div></details>
<br>
<p>As you can see, there are many benefits to this upgrade, but what is going to happen to the existing version of TCW?</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-happening-to-tcw-1x">What is happening to TCW 1.x?<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#what-is-happening-to-tcw-1x" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is happening to TCW 1.x?" title="Direct link to What is happening to TCW 1.x?">​</a></h2>
<p>The TCW 1.x version is going to continue to receive patch updates going forward as needed, but is essentially going into maintenance
mode with the goal to move <strong>everyone</strong> to the new Forge component library over time, and archive the 1.x version/repository. The new
version provides many bug fixes, features, improved performance and is where all new features will be added going forward. It is a
more modern implementation, with a lot of changes based on what we learned over the years from teams using TCW 1.x.</p>
<p>We plan to keep maintaining the 1.x version for a period of time to give teams a chance to upgrade to the new version, but it is now
officially considered <strong>deprecated</strong> at this time. You should perform this upgrade at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>If your team is facing issues with defining a timeline for upgrading, or if you have questions about the upgrade process, please reach
out to the Forge team for assistance!</p>

<p>There are always breaking changes that come with major version upgrades. It's an unfortunate, but beneficial side-effect. It's
the only way to innovate and keep up with the ever-changing web development ecosystem. That time has come.</p>
<p>You're probably thinking: "So what you're saying is I need to rewrite a lot of my code that I just wrote to start using Forge/TCW?"</p>
<p>We want to be very clear that this is <strong>not</strong> the case. This guide is intended to help you through this process, and after upgrading
several complex applications, we can assure you that it's actually quite a simple process, but it does require some attention. You
should not need to adjust any of your application logic aside from just renaming a few APIs that are related to Forge.</p>
<p>At a high level, here is what is changing: 🙈</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary><b>View changes</b></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><ul>
<li>Replace <code>node-sass</code> dependency with the API-compatible <code>sass</code> (Dart implementation) package.<!-- -->

<li>This dependency change is what enables us to use Sass modules, and you should too! See <a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#sass-modules">below</a> for more information on this subject.</li>
</ul>

<li>Replace <code>@tyler-components-web/cli</code> dependency with <code>@tylertech/forge-cli</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename TCW-related code to Forge-branded naming conventions:<!-- -->

This responsibility has been moved to developers to ensure flexibility, familiarity, and consistency with the usage of other Forge components such as the dialog.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note admonition_xJq3 alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>If you need to ensure one instance of the busy-indicator is visible across multiple components but you only need to update the message or progress, you may want

<p>The upgrade process can be broken down into several well-defined steps.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="step-1-dependencies">Step 1: dependencies<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#step-1-dependencies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: dependencies" title="Direct link to Step 1: dependencies">​</a></h3>
<p>The first thing we want to take care of is to fix our dependencies. This will immediately break a lot of things in our app.</p>
<p>Below is a mapping table of old vs new package names. Your application(s) will not make use of all of these, but please
evaluate and replace the dependencies within your <code>package.json</code> (where applicable) with the corresponding equivalent
package noted in the "New Package Name" column.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Old Package Name</th><th>New Package Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>@tylertech/tyler-components-web</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tylertech/tyler-components-web-angular</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-angular</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tylertech/tyler-components-web-react</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-react</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tyler-components-web/core</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-core</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tyler-components-web/cli</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-cli</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tylertech/build-tools</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-build-tools</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>@tyler-components-web/testing</code></td><td><code>@tylertech/forge-testing</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>node-sass</code></td><td><code>sass</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
<p>Next if you have the <code>@tylertech/tyler-icons</code> package installed, make sure it is at least version <code>^1.12.0</code>. We will need this version of
the package to access a new icon that will be used in the app-bar later on. If you don't have it explicitly installed then you can ignore
this because this version is already installed as a dependency of <code>@tylertech/forge</code> with the correct minimum version for you.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info admonition_xJq3 alert alert--info"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>It's worth noting that all of the new Forge-branded packages will be starting at version 2.0 to keep consistent with being an
evolution of the TCW library, we're just using new packages for better organization per the branding requirements.</p></div></div>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="step-2-find--replace-automated">Step 2: find &amp; replace (automated)<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2022/05/02/upgrade-guide-forge-2#step-2-find--replace-automated" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: find &amp; replace (automated)" title="Direct link to Step 2: find &amp; replace (automated)">​</a></h3>
<p>This step is the core of the upgrade process. We need to fix TCW references to the use the new Forge naming convention, and
upgrade any renamed APIs that we can without manually assessing each usage (we'll save that step for the end).</p>
<p>You're in luck! This process has been taken care of for you, if you choose to use it that is. We have gone ahead and created a utility
that you can run on your project(s), and it will handle as many of the updates as it can. There are still some manual adjustments
that you will need to evaluate after this utility is run, but it should get you <em>most</em> of the way there.</p>

<p>As noted above, the automated utility cannot handle everything without making assumptions on your behalf. This is where you must read the
breaking change details and determine if they affect your application or library. We wanted to make sure to note every possible change
that could affect your application, but we expect that most applications will only require updates to a subset of the following.</p>

<p>Now is the time to cross your fingers and attempt to build and run your application. At this point you probably feel as if you just completely broke everything, but
I can assure you that you are very close! Any build errors you get at this point will either be things the automated utility couldn't handle for you, or that you
didn't realize you were using from the list of breaking changes above.</p>

<p>Once you get your application building and running locally, it's time to manually validate everything by testing it out from a user's perspective. Navigate around your
app and look for any inconsistencies, broken features, or anything that may be out of place. Expand the section below for common visual inconsistencies you may run into:</p>

<p>As noted earlier, part of the Forge 2.0 process is to release the core/generic components to the open source community. While <em>most</em> components are already
generic enough, there are a few components that are still specific to Tyler, and we need to keep those internal and distribute them within a different package.
This will also provide us a library to share more domain specific components as we need them in the future!</p>

<p>The conversion from the Sass <code>@import</code> statement to Sass modules (<code>@use</code>) is fairly straightforward, but does introduce a shift in how CSS is generated, as well as how Sass mixins,
variables, functions... etc. are shared across files. While not required, it is highly recommended that you update your own Sass files to use the new syntax.</p>

<p>As you've likely seen by now, the <code>&lt;tcw-omnibar&gt;</code> has been renamed to <code>&lt;forge-app-bar&gt;</code> (including all related sub-components). Before moving on I wanted to draw attention to this change, as
some of the <code>slot</code> names have changed, and the default logo has been removed.</p>
<p>If you used the automated utility to upgrade, then the naming of the element(s) <em>should</em> have been updated for you. You will still want to evaluate your usage of the <code>slot</code> names though.
Expand the example below to see how the app-bar is expected to be used now:</p>
<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>View example</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>The slot names have been renamed to be more logical, rather than named after the content they were intended to hold.</p><ul>

<li><code>action</code> slot <strong>removed</strong>. Use <code>end</code> slot.</li>
<li><code>profile</code> slot renamed to <code>end</code></li>
</ul><p>Additionally, the default Tyler logo that was built-in to the omnibar before has been removed. It's expected that each application will render this icon manually now
in the <code>logo</code> slot.</p><div class="language-html codeBlockContainer_APcc theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#0f172a;--prism-background-color:#f1f5f9"><div

<p>There are several reasons you wouldn’t want to do this. First of all, your application is needlessly bloated by including Forge twice. But that is outside the scope of this document. We’ll focus on the issue this causes with custom elements.</p>
<p>Since <code>barApp</code> now runs with 2 copies of Forge, that means it will potentially attempt to register 2 different versions of each component in Forge. Remember the browser's <code>CustomElementRegistry</code> is effectively a dictionary. So you can’t register two different custom elements under the same key. So what happens is that whatever version registers first “wins”.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say <code>forge-selector v2.0.0</code> gets registered first for <code>fooLib</code>. Then later, <code>forge-selector v3.5.0</code> attempts to register for <code>barApp</code>. The key "forge-selector" is already registered, so the second registration attempt fails silently. But now <code>barApp</code> is stuck with <code>forge-selector v2.0.0</code>. Let’s say the newer version of <code>forge-selector</code> had added type-ahead functionality that we’re utilizing in <code>barApp</code>. However, now that the older version registered first, anywhere we’re using that new type-ahead feature is now broken with little to no leads as to what happened.</p>
<p>Hopefully, that illustrates the reason you wouldn’t ever want to set Forge as a dependency of a package.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="peer-dependencies">Peer dependencies<a href="https://forge.tylertech.com/blog/2020/05/06/package-dependencies#peer-dependencies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Peer dependencies" title="Direct link to Peer dependencies">​</a></h2>
<p>So how do we safely manage Forge versions?</p>
<p>If you need to create a library that utilizes Forge, declare it as a peer dependency for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>This means that your new library will need to implement Forge according to the version dictated by your dependent applications.</p>
<p>Going back to our earlier example involving <code>fooLib</code> and <code>barApp</code>. This time, <code>fooLib</code> declares Forge as a peer dependency.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info admonition_xJq3 alert alert--info"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>In this case, Forge is only included once in the application at <code>v3.5.0</code>. Since it’s included only once (by the application) there are no registration conflicts with any of the custom elements. But now <code>fooLib</code> is using <code>Forge v3.5.0</code> when it was originally implemented using <code>Forge v2.0.0</code>. Obviously, this can still lead to breaking changes in the Forge components since <code>fooLib</code> could be using features that no longer exist in <code>Forge v3.5.0</code>.</p></div></div>
<p>The solution is that both <code>fooLib</code> and <code>barApp</code> need to be kept within the same major version.</p>
<p>Forge follows <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semver</a> versioning practices. So we will not (intentionally) introduce any breaking changes within the same major version of Forge.</p>
<p>So if <code>fooLib</code> had a <em>peer</em> dependency of <code>Forge v1.0.1</code> and <code>barApp</code> had a dependency of <code>Forge v3.5.0</code>, there would be no breaking changes and both would work as expected.</p>

<ul>
<li>When possible, avoid including <code>dependencies</code> (of any kind) in your packages.</li>
<li>Use <code>peerDependencies</code> where it cannot be avoided.</li>
