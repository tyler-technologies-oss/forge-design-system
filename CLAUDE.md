# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Forge Design System documentation website built with Docusaurus 3. It serves as the primary documentation hub for Tyler Technologies' Forge design system, providing guidelines, components, patterns, and resources for designers and developers.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm start`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Type checking**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Serve production build**: `npm run serve`
- **Clear Docusaurus cache**: `npm run clear`
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: `npm run deploy`

## Architecture and Structure

### Content Organization
- `docs/` - Main documentation content organized by category:
  - `get-started/` - Getting started guides
  - `styles/` - Style guidelines and tokens
  - `content/` - UX content and writing guidelines
  - `assets/` - Icons, illustrations, and other assets
  - `components/` - Component documentation
  - `patterns/` - Design patterns and layouts
  - `recipes/` - Implementation examples
- `blog/` - Blog posts about design system updates
- `src/` - Custom React components and styling
- `static/` - Static assets served at the root

### Site Configuration
- `docusaurus.config.ts` - Main Docusaurus configuration
- `sidebars.js` - Sidebar navigation configuration using autogenerated structure
- Custom styling through SCSS in `src/styles/`

### Key Features
- **Search**: Local search powered by @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local
- **Image zoom**: Plugin for image zooming functionality
- **SASS support**: Custom styling with SCSS
- **External CDN assets**: Tyler font and icon libraries loaded from CDN
- **GitHub integration**: Edit links point to GitHub PR creation workflow

### Custom Components
Located in `src/components/`, includes specialized components for:
- Icon libraries and asset displays
- Do/don't examples and visual comparisons
- Recipe demonstrations
- Layout components (columns, image blocks)
- Status badges and component utilities

### Deployment
- Deployed to GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch
- Base URL configured for `forge.tylertech.com`
- Google Analytics tracking enabled

## Development Notes

- Uses TypeScript with Docusaurus presets
- Content is primarily Markdown with MDX support for React components
- Sidebar navigation is auto-generated from directory structure
- Commit messages follow conventional commit format with commitlint
- Uses Husky for Git hooks
